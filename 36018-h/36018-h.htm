<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>LEAVING HOME.</div>


<p>Leaving home to go to boarding school was
bad enough, but leaving on a damp, cold morning
before dawn seemed to be about the worst
thing that could befall a girl of fifteen. I have
noticed that whatever age you happen to be
seems to be the age in which hardships are the
most difficult to bear.</p>

<p>Anyhow, there I was, only fifteen, facing the
necessity of saying early morning farewells, the
first one of all to my comfortable bed, where I
had slept off and on, principally on, for those
fifteen years. And now I and my bed must part.</p>

<p>"Day done bus'ed, Miss Page. The doctor
is stirrin' an' you'd better rise an' shine," and
kind old Mammy Susan leaned yearningly over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
me. "I hate to wake up my lamb. I knowd dis
day would come when dey'd take you 'way from
me, but I nebber did think 'twould be 'fo' dawn
wif all de long day 'head er me to be studyin'
'bout you. What yo' mammy goin' ter do 'thout
you, chile?"</p>

<p>"Well, Mammy, we'll have to grin and bear it.
I'll be home Christmas, and that isn't so far
off." I jumped out of bed and pulled my hat-tub
into the middle of the floor, ready for my
daily cold sponge bath. Probably I had inherited
the habit of the cold bath from my English
grandfather along with the big hat-tub.</p>

<p>"Law, chile, can't you leave off punishin' yo'self
jes' dis onct? You can't be to say dirty, an'
dis here water is pow'ful cold."</p>

<p>Mammy and I had had this discussion about
my cold bath every morning since I had been
old enough to bathe myself. It was only after
many battles that she had stopped sneaking
warm water into my big can. That morning I
let it pass, although the water was lukewarm.</p>

<p>"Y'ain't mad wif yo' ole Mammy, is yer,
honey chile? Looks like I didn't have de heart<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
to plunge my baby lamb into sho'nuf cold water
on sech a dark chilly day, wif her a-leavin' an'
all. 'Tain't ter say warm now. I jes' tempered
it a leetle."</p>

<p>"That's all right, Mammy. 'God tempers the
wind to the shorn lamb' and you, it seems, temper
the water. They say there are lots of bathrooms
at Gresham, and I can have the water as
deep and cold as I want it."</p>

<p>"Well, don't you go drown yo'self in any er
dem new-fashioned plumbin' tubs, an' fer de
lan's sake, Miss Page, don't you let yo'self be
drawed down inter none er dem was'e pipes,"
and Mammy Susan hurried off to bring in the
all too early breakfast.</p>

<p>I dressed in my usual haste, putting on my
nice blue traveling suit, ordered by mail from
New York. It was quite long, well down to my
shoe tops, and I felt very stylish and grown-up.
I had never given any thought to my appearance,
and no one else in my life seemed to have
except Cousin Sue Lee and Mammy. I don't
know just what Cousin Sue thought about me,
but Mammy thought I was the most beautiful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
creature in the world and freely told me so.
That morning as I put on the little black velvet
toque, also purchased by mail, I looked at
myself very critically in the mirror.</p>

<p>"Page Allison, are you pretty or not? I, for
one, think not. You've got freckles on your
nose and your mouth is simply huge. I'd like
to say something about your eyes to take the conceit
out of you, but they look so like Father's
that I'd feel just like I was sassing him if I did.
Anyhow, I'm glad your hair curls."</p>

<p>I had intended to sentimentalize over leaving
my room and going out into the world, but I
forgot all about it, and grabbing my ready-packed
suitcase, also a mail order, I raced downstairs
as Mammy Susan rang the breakfast bell.</p>

<p>Father was already in the dining-room, standing
with his back to the little wood fire that
Mammy had kindled to cheer us up with. Mammy
always seemed to feel that when we were in
any distress she must warm us and feed us
whether we were cold and hungry or not. That
morning we were neither, but we warmed by
her fire and tried to choke down a great deal of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
her batter bread and roe herring to show her we
appreciated her efforts.</p>

<p>Father looked up as I came in and for a moment
regarded me in speechless amazement.</p>

<p>"Why, honey, you almost took my breath
away! You look so grown-up in the new dress
and hat. I didn't know you were so like your
Mother, child," and he drew me to him and
kissed me.</p>

<p>Father and I were as a rule not very demonstrative,
but I clung to him for a moment and
he held me close with his long, wiry arm.</p>

<p>"I wish I could take you to Gresham, honey,
but old Mrs. Purdy is very low and she expects
me to be with her at the end."</p>

<p>"That's all right, Father, don't you worry.
There are certain to be other girls on the train
who are going to Gresham and I'll butt in on
them," I answered much more bravely than I
felt. It did seem terribly lonely and forlorn to be
going off and installing myself in boarding school.
"I think it's fine that you can drive me over to
Milton and put me on the train. Last night when
I heard such a knocking at the door I was afraid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
I wouldn't see you in the morning because you'd
be off on some life or death mission. What was
the matter?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just Sally Winn's bread pills had given
out and she was afraid she would not last
through the night without them." Father always
took me into his confidence about the bread
pills he administered to the hypochondriacs.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Father, I believe if you charged
midnight fees for those bread-pill and pink-well-water
prescriptions, that Sally Winn and some
more just like her would at least wait until morning
to die."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, little daughter, Sally's got lots of
good in her, and trying to die is the only excitement
she has ever had in her whole life."</p>

<p>"Well, I won't begrudge it to her but I do
hate to have your rest broken. Mammy," I said
to Mammy Susan as she came in bearing a plate
of red-hot flannel cakes, "don't you let Father
be too late getting into his heavy underwear;
and make a row every time he drives the colt until
he will stop it from sheer weariness. And,
Father, you make Mammy take her tonic; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
don't let her go out in the wet dew waddling
around after her ducks. She will catch her
death."</p>

<p>"Susan, you hear Miss Page? Don't dare go
in anything but dry dew. A few inches on her
skirt and her curls tucked up under her bonnet
make her think she's been taking care of us all
these years instead of our taking care of her."</p>

<p>"Law, ain't she the spit of her Ma, Doc
Allison? 'Cep fer yo' eyes. Ain't quite so tall;
but she's young yit in spite er sich a long trailin'
skirt. I's sorry to be de one to break de news,
but de colt is out dere a-prancin' an' pawin', an'
ef you's a-goin' you'd better go."</p>

<p>I had often pictured my going away and had
always seen myself with difficulty restraining
my tears; but now the time had come and the colt
was cutting up, so I forgot to cry even when I
told the dogs good-by; and just as I was giving
Mammy Susan a last hug, and if tears were ever
to come they must hurry, Father called to me to
jump in, for he couldn't hold the colt another
minute. And in I was and away and not crying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
at all but laughing, as we turned around on one
wheel and went skimming down the drive.</p>

<p>The sun was all the way up at last and it
wasn't a cold, damp day at all, but promised to
be fair and clear. We had a six-mile drive to
the station at Milton and the colt saw to it that
we got there in plenty of time.</p>

<p>"Now, Page, be certain when you make the
change at Richmond, if you have to ask any questions
to ask them of a man in brass buttons."</p>

<p>"Yes, Father," and I smiled demurely, remembering
how I always acted as courier when we
went on our trips. Father, being the most absent-minded
of men except where his profession
was concerned, was not to be trusted with a railroad
ticket.</p>

<p>Moving away on the train at last and waving
good-by to his long, sad face, made me realize
that the knot was cut. What a good father he
was! How had we ever been able to make up
our minds to this boarding school scheme? Nothing
but the certainty that my education was a
very one-sided affair and that I must broaden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
out a bit had determined Father; and as for me,
I longed to know some girls.</p>

<p>I, who yearned for friends, was growing up
without any. Fifteen years old and I had never
had a real chum! I couldn't remember my
mother, but I am sure she would have been my
chum if she had lived. Mammy Susan did her
best and so did Father, but a little girl wants
another little girl. We had neighbors in plenty,
but our county seemed to be composed of old
maids and childless widows with a sparse sprinkling
of gray-bearded men.</p>

<p>My mother's people were English and she had
no relatives on this side of the water. Father
belonged to a huge family, all of them great visitors,
but so far as I knew, no children among
them. All kinds of old maids: rich and poor,
gentle and stern, soft and hard, big and little,
they all managed once a year to pay their dear
cousin, Dr. Allison, a visit at Bracken. I did
not mind their coming. The soft ones seemed to
have been little girls once, which was something.
I used to think when I was quite a little thing
that the hard ones must have been little boys,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
because of the statement in my Mother Goose
that little boys were made of "Snaps and snails
and puppy dog tails,"&mdash;not nice soft collie pups'
tails, either, but the tight, hard kind that grew
on Cousin Park Garnett's pug.</p>

<p>Cousin Park Garnett was the rich, hard one
whom I visited in Richmond the winter before.
On her annual visitation to us she had remarked
to my father:</p>

<p>"Cousin James, are Page's teeth sound?
White teeth like that are, as a rule, not very
strong. Her mouth is so enormous you had better
look to it that her teeth are preserved," and
she pursed up her own thin lips and put on her
green persimmon expression.</p>

<p>"Perfectly sound, I think, Cousin Park. Of
course her teeth must be preserved. As for her
mouth being big, she'll grow up to it." But the
outcome of the conversation was that I had to
visit Cousin Park and take in the dentist. Think
of the combination! Cousin Park took me to the
Woman's Club in the afternoon where we listened
to a lecture on "The Influence of Slavic
Literature on the Culture of the Day." I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
longing for the movies but managed to keep my
big mouth shut and listen to the lecture, so I
could tell Father about it and make him laugh.
I stayed in Richmond three days and did not
speak to one single soul under fifty. Even the
dentist was old and tottering, so shaky that I was
afraid he would fall into my mouth.</p>

<p>I saw loads of nice girls my own age skating
on the sidewalk or walking arm-in-arm chattering
away very happily, but Cousin Park didn't
know who they were or did know and knew
nothing to their credit. I was glad to get back
to Bracken where there were no girls to know.
There were at least the dogs at Bracken that I
could talk to and race over the hills with. Even
Cousin Park could not doubt their royal pedigrees.</p>

<p>It was dear little Cousin Sue Lee who persuaded
Father and me both that I ought to go
to boarding school. Cousin Sue was the best of
all Father's female relatives. She was gentle
and poor and had a job in the Congressional
Library in Washington. With all her gentleness,
she was sprightly and had plenty of what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Father called "Lee spunk"; and with all her poverty,
she wore the sweetest clothes and always
brought me a lovely present every year and a
nice shawl for Mammy or a black silk waist or
something or other to delight the old woman's
heart. Cousin Park never gave me anything,&mdash;not
that I wanted her to. She would visit us
two weeks and then present Mammy with a dime,
using all the pomp and ceremony that a twenty-dollar
gold piece would have warranted.</p>

<p>"Jimmy," Cousin Sue had said one day (she
was the only one of all the cousins who called
Father Jimmy), "I know you and Page will think
I am an interfering old cat, but that child ought
to go to school. I am not going to say a word
about her education. She has an excellent education
in some things. I have never seen a better
read girl of her age. But the time may come
when she will regret knowing no French, and
she tells me she stopped arithmetic last year and
never started algebra."</p>

<p>"Well, what good did algebra ever do you or
me?" quizzed Father.</p>

<p>"Now, Jimmy, don't ask such foolish questions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
It's just something all of us have to have. What
good does your cravat do you? None; it's not
even a thing of beauty, but you have to have one
all the same."</p>

<p>"Oh, you women," laughed Father, "there's
no downing you with argument."</p>

<p>"But as I was saying," continued Cousin Sue,
"it is not dear little Page's education I am thinking
of. It's something much more important. I
want her to know a whole lot of girls and make
a million friends. Why, I'm the only young
friend the child has, and I am getting to be
nearer fifty than forty."</p>

<p>And so we wrote for catalogues of schools and
settled on Gresham. And Cousin Sue sent for a
bolt of nainsook and yards and yards of lace and
insertion and made up a whole lot of pretty underclothes
for me.</p>

<p>"Girls need a lot of things in this day and generation,"
I heard her say to Father. "A great
deal more than they used to when I was young.
I am determined Page shall not go off to school
looking like an 'Orphan Annie.'"</p>

<p>"But, Sue, your holiday won't do you any good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
if you spend it all sewing on the machine for
my child," objected Father.</p>

<p>"We'll get in Miss Pinky Davis to help and
in a week's time Page will have enough clothes
to last her until she gets married,&mdash;that is, if she
does not follow the traditions of the family and
be an old maid."</p>

<p>It was a pretty well known fact that Cousin
Sue had been a belle in her day, and even now
when she came back to visit in the County several
weather-beaten bachelor farmers would
manage to have business at Bracken. I have always
noticed that an old maid who is so from
choice does not mind joking about it, but the
others do.</p>

<p>A country doctor is seldom a bloated bond-holder;
so Cousin Sue and I ordered, with great
care and economy, the necessary things from
New York: suit, hat, gloves, shoes, up-to-date
shirt waists and plenty of middies, a raincoat,
umbrella, etc.</p>

<p>"Now, my dear," said my sweet cousin, "you
can be perfectly sure that your outfit is appropriate
at least. Your clothes are stylish, well-made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and suitable to your age. I have always
felt that young people's clothes should be so
right that they do not have to think about them."</p>

<p>As I sped away on the train to Richmond, I
remembered what Cousin Sue had said before
she went back to the grind in Washington, and
had a feeling of intense satisfaction that my little
trunk in the baggage car held such a complete
wardrobe that I would not have to bother my
head about it any more. Up to this summer,
clothes had been my abomination, but I had at
last waked up to the fact that it made some difference
how I looked; and now I was going to
look all right without any trouble to myself.</p>

<p>Train pulling into Richmond and still not
a tear! "What is the matter with you, Page
Allison? When girls leave their childhood's
home in books they always weep suds. Don't
you love your home as much as a stick of a heroine
in a book?" I knew I loved my home, but
somehow it was so delightful to be going somewhere
and maybe getting to know a million people,
as Cousin Sue said I must.</p>

<p>An hour's wait in Richmond! I rechecked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
my trunk, having purchased a ticket to Gresham;
then I seated myself to possess my soul in patience
until the 10.20 train should be called. The
station in Richmond was familiar enough to me,
as Father and I took some kind of a trip every
year and always had to come through Richmond.
As I have said before, I attended to tickets and
baggage when I traveled with Father, so I was
not in the least nervous over doing it now.</p>

<p>"I must keep my eye open for girls who are
likely to be going to Gresham," I thought.
"They'll all have on dark blue suits." That
was a rule of the school, the dark blue suit.
"There's one now! But can she be going?" And
I thought of what Cousin Sue had said of "Orphan
Annie."</p>

<p>The girl was seated opposite me in the waiting
room. She had just come up the steps lugging
a huge telescope, stretched to its greatest capacity,
and looking nervously around had sunk on a
bench. She searched feverishly through a shabby
little hand-bag she was carrying and having satisfied
herself that the ticket she had just purchased
was safe she seemed to be trying to compose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
herself; but one could see with half an eye
that she was nervous and frightened. She
glanced uneasily at the clock every few minutes
and constantly compared with it an Ingersoll
watch which each time she had to search for in
her bag. Several trains were called and every
time she got up and made a rush for the gates,
but each time came back to her seat opposite me.</p>

<p>Her blue dress was evidently homemade. The
skirt dragged in the back and the jacket was too
short for the prevailing fashion. Her hat had
been worn as mourning and still had a little fold
of cr&ecirc;pe around the edge, making a suitable setting
for that tear-stained face. I couldn't tell
whether she was pretty or not, her features were
so swollen with weeping. Helen of Troy herself
looked homely crying, I am sure. I noticed that
her throat was milk white and that the thick plait
of hair that hung down her back, mercifully
concealing somewhat the crooked seams of the
ill-made jacket, was as yellow as ripe wheat.</p>

<p>"Poor thing," I thought, "I believe I'll speak
to her and see if I can cheer her up some." But
my philanthropic resolution was forgotten because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
of the entrance into the waiting room and
into my life, I am glad to add, of the three most
delightful and original persons I have ever seen
or known.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>ENTER THE TUCKERS.</div>


<p>Two girls about my age and a youngish man
were the arrivals. The girls were dressed in
blue serge, and I felt in my bones that they were
going to Gresham. They had an independent,
easy way with them, and evidently considered
the youngish man a person whom they had a
right to boss.</p>

<p>"Let's sit here, Zebedee, and you go get the
milk chocolate for me," exclaimed one of the
girls.</p>

<p>"Don't forget my salted peanuts and a copy of
'Life,'" called the other, as Zebedee hurried
off to make the purchases at the newsstand in a
corner of the waiting room.</p>

<p>"Elder brother," thought I, "and pretty good-natured
to wait on those girls so much." What
nice looking girls they were, though. At the
first glance, they looked singularly alike, but as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
I examined them more closely while Zebedee was
gone, I saw points of dissimilarity. "They are
twins, for sure," I said to myself, "but I believe
I am going to be able to tell them apart." The
one whom her sister called Dum had red lights
in her almost black hair and her eyes were hazel,
while the one who answered to the name of Dee
had blue lights in her coal black hair and her
eyes were gray. Both of them had sharply defined
brows, straight noses, and broad, laughing
mouths. Dum's chin was square and determined,
but in Dee's there lurked a dimple. They
were exactly the same height and both of them
had fine athletic figures.</p>

<p>"There you are, Tweedles," said the youngish
man, addressing them both as he pitched his
purchases into their laps. "Who's going to wait
on you at boarding school, I'd like to know?"</p>

<p>"Well, if you will make us have a roommate,
I reckon she'll have to," laughed Dee.</p>

<p>"By the way, Zebedee, that is something I
want to discuss with you," and Dum squared her
chin. "You make a great mistake in forcing a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
roommate on Dee and me. We are not used to
it, and we are not going to stand it."</p>

<p>Zebedee squared his chin, too, and his blue
eyes took on a stern expression. "Not going to
stand it, eh? Well, I say you are going to stand
it. We have discussed the matter threadbare
already, and you must trust me to know what is
best for you sometimes."</p>

<p>The stern light went out of his eyes and into
them came a look of infinite tenderness as he
put an arm around Dum and held her close to
him. I certainly liked the looks of Zebedee,
but what a name! He, too, had an athletic figure,
but not very tall, not much taller than the
girls, who were very well grown for fifteen. He
had Dum's red black hair, also her square chin,
but Dee's dimple had found a place in the middle
of that determined chin. The three mouths
were so alike that they might have belonged to
triplets, but his eyes were his own; ice blue they
were in color but there was nothing cold about
them. They were the kindest, merriest eyes;
they seemed to see everything and feel everything.
Just now they were feeling very sorry for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Dum, and as he hugged her, big tears gathered
in them.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dum," exclaimed Dee, "now you have
made him cry!"</p>

<p>"No such thing. I'm not crying," and he
shamelessly blew his nose.</p>

<p>I afterwards learned that one of the characteristics
of this delightful trio was that they
thought there was no more shame in crying than
laughing. They laughed in church if there was
anything to laugh at, and cried at a picnic or
farce-comedy if anything turned up to move
them to tears. "We don't bawl," Dee said to
me once, "we just leak. It is all a matter of tear
ducts. We can't help it any more than you could
help sneezing if someone shook pepper in your
face."</p>

<p>A train was called. It was not ours, but "Orphan
Annie" jumped nervously from her seat.
She dropped her shabby little hand-bag, which
she had just opened for the hundredth time to
make sure her ticket was safe or to compare her
Ingersoll watch with the clock in the station, and
the contents of the bag rolled to the floor. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
dived to assist her and the person called Zebedee
did the same. Of course we bumped heads, and
while we were apologizing, Dum and Dee picked
up the scattered belongings and returned them to
the poor, abashed girl.</p>

<p>"I just knew you were going to Gresham,"
said Dee, handing her the much-thumbed ticket,
"and wondered how long it would take us to get
to the point of speaking to you."</p>

<p>"You are for Gresham, too," said Dum, turning
to me. "I have been longing to know you.
I might have known that old Zebedee would end
by butting in."</p>

<p>Here Zebedee took off his hat and bowed to
"Orphan Annie" and me as though we were of
the blood royal, and said with a most engaging
manner:</p>

<p>"We had best introduce ourselves and then all
the conventionalities will be observed. Conventionality
is a mighty important thing for boarding
school girls to observe. These are the Tucker
twins, called Tweedles when you want both of
them or aren't particular which one answers.
This red-headed one is Dum; this blue-headed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
one, Dee. They have other official names, but
somehow I can't remember them to-day. I am
Jeffry Tucker, at your service, the father of the
Heavenly Twins."</p>

<p>"Father! You, their father!" I gasped.</p>

<p>"Certainly. Whose father did you think I
was?"</p>

<p>"James' and John's," I answered flippantly.</p>

<p>"That's the reason we called him Zebedee,"
chorused the twins. "You know the old gag:
'Who is the father of Zebedee's children?' No
one ever believes he is really a parent."</p>

<p>I burst out laughing and so did "Orphan
Annie." I was certainly glad to see that she
could laugh. Already the genial atmosphere that
surrounded the Tuckers had had its effect on
her. The drawn expression was leaving her
countenance and the hearty laugh dispelled the
mist in her eyes. The knowledge that there were
two other passengers for Gresham set her mind
at rest, and she evidently felt relieved.</p>

<p>"My name is Page Allison."</p>

<p>"Daughter of Dr. James Allison of Milton, I
bet anything," ventured Mr. Tucker.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
"Oh, do you know my father?" I asked joyfully.</p>

<p>"Of course I do. We are of the same fraternity.
Your eyes are so like his, I came mighty
near slipping you the grip. He was in the class
of '85 and I was in that of '99, but we have met
at many fraternity conventions. I am certainly
glad to know his daughter." And while he did
not give me the fraternity grip, he gave me some
kind of a grip that tingled all the way up to my
heart.</p>

<p>"And won't you tell us your name?" said Dee
kindly to the other stranger.</p>

<p>"Annie Pore," said the girl in a voice singularly
full and rich. "I have never been anywhere
alone and I am so afraid I'll miss my train. That
is the reason I dropped my bag. I am so much
obliged to all of you for picking up my things."</p>

<p>Her timidity seemed to disappear as she realized
she was making friends. As for me, I have
never known what it was to be timid, and I felt
at home with the three Tuckers from the moment
they entered the waiting room; and from
the time that Mr. Tucker and I bumped heads,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
I counted them as the first three on the list of
the million friends that Cousin Sue said I must
make.</p>

<p>"Well, since we are all going to Gresham, suppose
you young ladies hand over your tickets to
me and I will be courier for the crowd," said
Mr. Tucker.</p>

<p>I gave him my ticket, also my reservation in
the parlor car. It made no difference how poor
payments were, Father and I always traveled in
comfort. "It saves in the end to ride in a clean,
comfortable coach," Father declared. "Saves
wear and tear on clothes and nerves."</p>

<p>Annie Pore handed him her rumpled ticket.</p>

<p>"This is all you have?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, isn't that all right?" she entreated.
"The man at the ticket window assured me it
was right."</p>

<p>"Of course it is all right. Now there are five
minutes before the train will be called, so if you
young ladies will excuse me, I'll run downstairs
to see that Tweedles' trunks are safe. By the
way, have you attended to your luggage?" he
asked me. "And you?" turning to Annie Pore.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you, yes," I answered; but the other
girl looked piteously at her bursting telescope.
"I haven't a trunk," she said simply.</p>

<p>I felt mighty sorry for Annie. The Tucker
twins did, too. I could tell by their eyes. Dee's
filled and Dum turned and walked to the steps
with her father.</p>

<p>Dee whispered to me as she pretended to show
me a picture in "Life":</p>

<p>"He's gone to get her a ticket in the parlor
car. Just like him! Such a thoughtful Zebedee
as he is! We mustn't let him know we are on.
That would make him raging. He will carry it
off perfectly naturally, and he is fully capable
of any deceit to keep Annie Pore from finding
it out."</p>

<p>He had done exactly as Dee said he would do:
got a chair in the parlor car for "Orphan Annie."
Right there I took myself to task for thinking
of the poor girl as "Orphan Annie," and I determined
to control my thoughts if possible and
give her her proper name in my mind. Not that
Annie Pore sounded much more cheerful than
the name I had given her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Our train was called and our kind courier bundled
up bag and baggage and hustled us through
the gates and into the chair car before Annie
Pore had time to ask about it; and then he gave
the Pullman conductor our tickets and settled us
and the train started, and the girl never did
know she was being treated to a privilege her
ticket did not give her.</p>

<p>We had a jolly trip and before it was over I
knew a great deal about the Tuckers, and they,
in turn, a great deal about me, in fact, about all
there was to know. It was many a day, however,
before we broke through Annie Pore's reserve
and learned that she was of English parentage,
that her mother had recently died and
her father had a country store in a lonesome little
settlement on the river. No wonder the girl
was so scary. This was actually her first railroad
journey. What traveling she had done had
been by boat, an occasional trip to Norfolk or
Richmond when her father went to town to buy
his stock.</p>

<p>There was an unmistakable air of breeding
about her. Her accent was pure and her English<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
without flaw. In spite of her timidity, she
had a certain <i>savoir faire</i>. For instance, when
Mr. Tucker announced that we were to have
lunch with him and ordered the porter to bring
two tables and put them up, Annie accepted the
invitation with a quiet grace that many a society
woman could not have equaled. When she took
off her ugly hat, disclosing to view a calm white
forehead with heavy, ripe-wheat hair rippling
from a part, I had no doubt of the fact that
Annie Pore, if not already a beauty, was going
to be one when she grew up.</p>

<p>It was only a buffet luncheon and there was
not much on the menu to choose from: baked
beans, canned soup, potted meats, etc.</p>

<p>"Not much to eat here," grumbled Mr. Tucker.</p>

<p>"Eat what's put before you, Zebedee, and stop
grouching," admonished Dum.</p>

<p>"Well, it's a pretty hard state of affairs when
a fellow wants to give a party and there is nothing
to eat but these canned abominations."</p>

<p>"I have a lunch box in my grip," I ventured;
"maybe that would help out some."</p>

<p>"Trot it out, do!" cried Dee.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>And then Annie had the hardihood to untie
the rope around her telescope and bring out a
bag of the very best and rosiest wine-sap apples
I ever tasted. She also produced a box of doughnuts
she had made herself which were greeted
with enthusiasm. My lunch had been put up
by kind old Mammy Susan, and in her tenderness
she had packed in enough to feed a regiment.</p>

<p>"Fried chicken!" exclaimed Dee, clapping her
hands.</p>

<p>"Columbus eggs!" shouted Dum.</p>

<p>"Not really country ham?" questioned Mr.
Tucker. "That is too good to be true. You
must excuse Tweedles and me, but we have been
living in an apartment and eating in the caf&eacute;,
and some real home food has just about got us
going. When I asked you young ladies to lunch,
I did not dream that I would be able to treat
you so royally."</p>

<p>"Look, Zebedee, look! Clover-leaf rolls!"
chorused the twins.</p>

<p>"Stop tweedling and look over the menu and
see what we shall order to supplement with."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Mr. Tucker called it tweedling when the girls
spoke in chorus as was their habit.</p>

<p>We decided on cream of tomato soup, iced tea
and butter, with Neopolitan ice cream to top off
with. I was certainly glad that, as usual,
Mammy Susan had paid no attention to my commands,
and had done her own sweet will in giving
me enough lunch for half a dozen girls.</p>

<p>"It's bes' to err on de side er plenty, honey
baby," the old woman had said when I demurred
at the size of the lunch boxes. "Even ef you is
goin' to a land flowin' wif milk an' honey, a few
rolls to sop in de honey won't go amiss an' some
chicken an' ham to wash down wif de milk won't
hurt none."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>GRESHAM.</div>


<p>Gresham at last after a very pleasant trip! We
had picked up blue-coated girls all along the
road, and by the time we reached the little town
on the outskirts of which our school was situated,
the train seemed to be running over with
girls.</p>

<p>"There must be a million of them," I thought;
but as Gresham could only accommodate one
hundred and twenty-five, I was wrong. Some
of them had mothers or fathers with them, and
some of them big brothers or sisters. Most of
them had some one; at least, most of the new
girls.</p>

<p>The old pupils hugged and kissed one another
and all seemed to be glad to get back to school.
The new girls looked sad and miserable, even
the ones who had their mothers with them. And
a few lonesome ones who had brought themselves,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
like "Orphan Annie" (there, I slipped
again and called Annie Pore by that obnoxious
name!) or me, looked like scared rabbits. I
wasn't scared a bit, and when I saw the old girls
hugging and loving one another, flaunting their
intimacies, as it were, I said:</p>

<p>"Don't you mind, Page Allison. You are going
to know all of those girls and like a lot of
them, and a lot of them are going to like you;
and they are just a few of the million friends
you are going to make."</p>

<p>In the crowded confusion at the little station,
I was separated from the Tuckers and noticed
that poor Annie was put in a bus filled with
Seniors, who looked at her rather askance. Her
ungainly telescope was piled up with the natty
suitcases by the driver's seat, and I saw him
point at it and wink at the driver of the bus
where I had found a seat.</p>

<p>The girls in the bus with me were very kind
and friendly. There were several mothers along
and they looked at me cordially, and in a few
minutes I knew the names of all the passengers
and they knew mine. By the time the straining<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
horses had pulled the heavy bus through the
crooked streets of the quaint little town, up and
down the many hills and finally up the last long
hill to Gresham School, the whole load of girls
and mothers had been jolted into an enforced
intimacy.</p>

<p>Bracken, my home, was situated in what persons
from the mountains call a flat country but
which we call rolling, as it is when compared to
the tidewater counties. So the hills of Gresham
seemed wonderfully steep to me, and as we pulled
to the top and stopped in front of the school, and
I realized we could actually see the mountains,
I gave voice to a long-drawn "O&mdash;h!" of delight.</p>

<p>We piled out of the bus, and for a moment I
stood looking at the wonderful view before I
even noticed the school building.</p>

<p>"I am so glad you like it," said a soft voice at
my side. It belonged to a quiet-looking girl who
had come up with us. She looked a little older
than the rest of the girls and certainly was much
more dignified. "I find if a new pupil notices
the mountains first, she is pretty apt not to kick
because they have dessert only twice a week.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
One can't have everything in this world, and a
mountain view is more filling in the big end than
dessert."</p>

<p>"It is splendid! You have been here a long
time?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, many years; and now I am a pupil
teacher. This place seems more like home than
any other in the world to me," and she took me
by the arm. "Come on with me, Page. I am going
to call you Page and I do wish you could call
me Margaret, but now that I am a near teacher
I have to be called Miss Sayre. I am going to
introduce you to Miss Peyton, the principal."</p>

<p>"Oh, you are kind to me and I am so much
obliged!"</p>

<p>"Give the bus driver your trunk check and in
his good time he will deliver your trunk. Come
on, so you can get into the office before the rush
of Seniors."</p>

<p>Just then the vehicle with Annie Pore in it,
looking too forlorn for words, came rattling up.
Her hat was knocked over one eye and she had
lost all of the cheerfulness that she had gained on
the train with the delightful Tuckers. No one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
had paid any attention to her on the ride, except
to look her up and down and make whispered
jokes at her expense. I have found out that girls
can be the most cruel creatures in the world, just
from pure thoughtlessness and lack of imagination.
They don't know how to "Put yourself in
his place." They don't mean to hurt, but they
do hurt all the same. I found during the ensuing
year that that same busload of Seniors included
many a fine character, but not one of
them seemed to have imagination enough to
know what Annie Pore was suffering.</p>

<p>"Miss Sayre," I said impulsively, "please take
this girl with you. I met her on the train and
she seems so forlorn."</p>

<p>"We'll miss our chance to reach Miss Peyton
ahead of the others, unless we hurry," she said,
looking a little impatient at my request.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry. I think I ought to wait for her,
but don't let me detain you," and I went forward
to meet poor Annie.</p>

<p>Of course, Miss Sayre came, too. "I might
have known that a girl who noticed the mountains
first thing would have character enough to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
do what she thought was right," she whispered
as she followed me.</p>

<p>"This is Annie Pore, Miss Sayre," I said, as
I helped the cramped girl out of her uncomfortably
small quarters. Miss Sayre shook her
hand cordially and I hoped Annie did not hear
the titter as one of the Seniors nudged another
and said in an audible whisper: "Annie Pore,
poor Orphan Annie." I hated myself for having
had the same thought.</p>

<p>"Where is your trunk check, Annie? Give it
to the bus driver," said Miss Sayre, kindly.</p>

<p>"I haven't a trunk," said Annie faintly, "just
a telescope."</p>

<p>"By their luggage ye shall know them," said a
stylish girl who was clambering out of the vehicle.
She spoke in a rasping tone with a nasal
touch.</p>

<p>Annie Pore made a ten strike right then and
there with me and with all of the girls who heard
what she said, and those girls who did not hear
it soon heard about it. She drew herself up, no
longer timid but with what Dum Tucker afterwards
called "Annie's stage presence," and in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
her singularly clear, full voice, that voice that
we were all to be so proud of, said:</p>

<p>"Not by their luggage ye shall know them, but
by their voices." And with a dignity that a
sagging skirt and crooked-seamed jacket could
not lessen, Annie Pore walked to the front of the
carry-all and demanded from the grinning
driver her bursting telescope.</p>

<p>A shout went up from the Seniors. "Annie,
Annie, 'rah, 'rah, 'rah!"</p>

<p>"So, Mabel Binks, she got your goat that
time," laughed a bright-looking, auburn-haired
Senior.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean, Sally Coles.
Orphan Annie's remark seemed to me to be
without point," and Mabel Binks haughtily demanded
a very swell new alligator bag from the
front seat.</p>

<p>"Well, if you don't know that your voice needs
greasing, it is not for me to break it to you,
Mabel." Mabel flounced off, and all her stylish
clothes, beautifully-hanging skirt, well-cut jacket,
and jaunty velvet sailor hat, did not give dignity
to her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Pandemonium reigned as we entered the spacious
hall of the main building. Girls, girls,
girls! Little and big; fat and thin; pretty and
plain; laughing and crying; alone and attended,
they swarmed over everything.</p>

<p>"We have lost our chance to get first at the
principal, but I wouldn't have missed seeing
Annie Pore take down that common, purse-proud
Mabel Binks for a million, as poor as I am," whispered
Miss Sayre. "You girls sit here and wait
for me, and as soon as there is an opening we'll
slip in."</p>

<p>"Oh, how could I ever have made up my mind
to leave my Father and come here?" wailed
Annie, crumpling up into an ignominious heap,
all her dignity gone.</p>

<p>"Now look here, Annie Pore," I scolded, "anyone
who could jaw back at a Senior as you did
just a moment ago has got backbone, and you
have just got to get a brace on you and cheer up."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you are different. You make friends
so readily. I am so easily embarrassed," and
the poor thing wept anew.</p>

<p>"I don't make friends a bit more easily than
you do. I just want to make them, that's the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
difference. Haven't you made friends with me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, have I really?"</p>

<p>"Of course you have. Would I be ragging
you this way if I didn't consider myself your
friend? Haven't you made friends with all three
of the Tuckers, and now with Miss Sayre?"</p>

<p>Annie was somewhat consoled and tried to
take a more cheerful view of life. We had completely
lost sight of our traveling companions.
They had evidently been admitted among the
first to the principal's office. All of the girls
who were accompanied by their parents or guardians
were given preference in having their
rooms assigned them, so that their loved ones
could see where the daughters were to be placed
and then take their departure on the outgoing
trains.</p>

<p>We were so hidden by the swarming girls, we
despaired of ever being found again by Miss
Sayre; but I persuaded Annie that we would
certainly be placed by bedtime as both of us had
been registered during the summer; and in the
meantime, it was rather fun to watch the girls
and try to guess where they came from and if
any of them were to be in our classes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Mabel Binks backed up against us, talking to
an overdressed girl of about nineteen. Both
were dressed in the latest style. I knew what
those styles were from the fashion books that
Cousin Sue Lee had bought when we were planning
my modest wardrobe.</p>

<p>"I am thankful to say this is my last year at
Gresham," said Mabel. "The place has lost tone
so. We came up in the bus with a most remarkable-looking
person. I am sure Mamma would
not permit me to remain if she knew Miss Peyton
was allowing such ordinary girls to come
here."</p>

<p>Annie Pore's face was crimson and she looked
ready to burst into tears, but the overdressed
girl, whose name, I afterwards learned, was Josephine
Barr, and who was a thoroughly kindly
person, remarked:</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I heard about that girl. Sally Coles
tells me she is wonderfully pretty and quite a
lady, also that she got a yell from the Seniors
for her quickness in responding to a sally from
you."</p>

<p>I pinched Annie's arm and whispered: "What
did I tell you? Two more new friends, Sally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Coles and this big girl who has just punctured
Mabel Binks' conceit."</p>

<p>"Come along, girls," and Miss Sayre pushed
her way to our retreat. "I think we can get
into the office now. How do you do, Josephine?
I am glad to see you back," and she shook the
big girl's hand cordially. "I want to introduce
you to two new girls and ask you to see that they
meet the crowd."</p>

<p>"All right, Margaret, what you say goes. I
was a freshy myself once and know how it feels."
She gave us a cordial grip and assured us we
must call on her if we needed anything, friendly
counsel or protection or even soothing syrup.</p>

<p>"Jo is a fine old girl," said Miss Sayre, as
she hooked one arm in mine and the other in
Annie Pore's and drew us into the office. (I
noticed that she had completely ignored Mabel
Binks.) "She would fight to the finish for her
friends. Her clothes are impossible, but we
mustn't judge the poor thing by her clothes.
They've got so much money, they don't know
what to do with it. I'm real sorry for her."</p>

<p>It seemed a queer cause for pity to Annie and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
me, but Miss Sayre was introducing us to Miss
Peyton and we could not ask her why riches
were to be pitied. I liked Miss Peyton from the
minute I saw her and I believe she liked me. Her
countenance was a noble one, her manner frank,
and her voice sounded like music.</p>

<p>"I am going to put you into the room with
some sisters, Page. I hope you will get along
well together. If everything is not pleasant,
come directly to me. You are No. 117 in Carter
Hall. I will see all the girls to-morrow and classify
them. Miss Sayre, will you please get someone
to show Page her room? Now I will talk
to Annie Pore and assign her her roommate."
And Miss Peyton went on quietly with what
might have been a confusing task, but which she
managed as calmly as a Napoleon marshaling
his troops.</p>

<p>I found my way to 117 Carter Hall with the
help of an old girl. I was naturally quite interested
to know what the sisters were to be like
who were to be my roommates for the year.
The door to 117 was open and I heard sobbing.</p>

<span class="caption">They made such a racket that a sad, crooked face was poked into the door.&mdash;Page 48.</span>
</div>

<p>"Heavens, I'm tired of tears!" I thought as
my conductor left me with a significant smile.
"I'm actually damp from all of the weeping going
on around me."</p>

<p>A stormy voice was raised in the room that I
was about to enter, and I stopped in the hall,
not knowing just what to do.</p>

<p>"Now what did I tell you?" said the stormy,
sobbing voice. "Didn't I tell you all along I was
going to make myself just as disagreeable as I
could if you would put someone in with us?
Aren't we going to be miserable enough without
you, without having some old stick-in-the-mud
hoisted on us from the country, to sleep in the
room with us; and just as like as not want the
window shut at night; and rub her chapped face
all over with mutton-suet? Paugh, I can smell
it now, the horrid stuff."</p>

<p>"Now, Dum, cut it out. You don't even know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
that your roommate gets chapped," said a whimsical
voice.</p>

<p>"The Tuckers!" I exclaimed, but naturally had
a delicacy in entering, after what I had heard
Dum say about a roommate from the country.
"Could she know that I am the one?" I asked
myself.</p>

<p>"Well, how are Dee and I to fight it out the
way you have brought us up to do if we have
got some old mutt in here with us? We might
just as well have left our boxing gloves at
home."</p>

<p>"Oh, Dum, you are making it hard for me,"
said poor Mr. Tucker.</p>

<p>"That's good, I want to make it hard," sobbed
the wretched Dum.</p>

<p>"I have told you over and over that I think
it best for you and Dee to have to control yourselves
more, and the only way to do it is to realize
how your tantrums affect other people. You
are the best old Tweedles in the world, but you
have no self-control. I am surely sorry for your
roommate, whoever she may be."</p>

<p>"Well," broke in Dee, "I think it all depends<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
on who she is. I must say it is some lottery.
Roommates ought to be carefully chosen; one
should not just trust to this grab-bag method."</p>

<p>"Well, how do you know Miss Peyton has not
chosen someone she feels will be suitable? I wish
it would turn out to be somebody like the little
girl on the train. Don't you, Tweedles?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" tweedled Tweedles. "But no such
luck."</p>

<p>This reassured me and I knocked on the open
door. There was perfect silence, broken only
by the sound of Dum's blowing her nose and
Mr. Tucker's clearing his throat; and then a
faint little "Come in," from both girls.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you! How good of you to come look
us up!" exclaimed Mr. Tucker. "We were afraid
it was the hated roommate. Tweedles are treating
me so terribly because I insist on their having
a roommate so they can broaden out a bit
and learn to control themselves some, which they
will never do so long as they stay together all
the time. I'll leave it to you, Miss Page, don't
you think it will be best?"</p>

<p>"Well, I have a delicacy in saying," laughed I.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
"You see, I am that poor unfortunate, despised
roommate. This is 117 Carter Hall, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Then all the weeping was turned to laughter
and the irrepressible Tuckers, father and all,
grabbed hands and danced around me singing,
"Gayly cheer the bride." They made such a
racket that a sad, crooked face was poked into
the door, evidently feeling a duty to admonish,
but Zebedee in his most Zebedeeish humor, sang
out in a friendly voice:</p>

<p>"Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will
you join the dance? Will you, won't you, will
you, won't you, won't you join the dance?"</p>

<p>Then the strangest thing happened to that
long, sad, crooked face. The plain features were
illuminated by a smile, the person who owned the
face came impulsively into the room, and after
she had carefully shut the door, she caught hold
of hands with the crazy trio and the dance went
on; and all of us sang:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Will you walk a little faster!' said a whiting to a snail,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>'There's a porpoise close behind us and he's treading on my tail.<br />
See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!<br />
They are waiting on the shingle&mdash;will you come and join the dance?'"<br />
</div>

<p>Then the chorus: "Will you, won't you, will
you, won't you, will you join the dance?"</p>

<p>I refused to play "frog in the middle" any
longer and broke into the dance, soon dropping
into the unfamiliar tune but very familiar words
of the Lobster Quadrille. We sang all four of
the verses from that immortal nonsense.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'What matters it how far we go?' his scaly friend replied,<br />
'There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.<br />
The farther off from England, the nearer is to France.<br />
Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.'"<br />
</div>

<p>The owner of the long, sad, crooked face was
also owner of a singularly clear, true, well-trained
voice, and Mr. Tucker's fresh baritone
fitted in finely, while Dum and Dee and I did the
best we could with what Nature had seen fit to
endow us in the way of voices. Finally we girls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
sank exhausted on the bare, uncovered beds, but
Mr. Tucker and the mysterious visitor stood
clasping hands.</p>

<p>"Jeff Tucker, what in Heaven's name are you
doing at a young ladies' boarding school?"</p>

<p>"Entering my girls: Tweedles. And you,
Jinny Cox, what are you doing here?" And Mr.
Tucker kept on shaking her hand.</p>

<p>"I teach singing here. Have been here for
years. And to think of your girls being old
enough to go to boarding school! It seems only
yesterday that you and dear little Virginia were
leading the germans at the University. I haven't
seen you since you married. I meant to write
you when Virginia died, but somehow I just
couldn't."</p>

<p>"That was all right, Jinny. I knew how you
felt without hearing from you. She only lived a
year, you know. Tweedles were just a few weeks
old when she died." And the dear man who a
moment before had been so cheerily singing the
Lobster Quadrille, now wiped his eyes and
seemed given over to melancholy.</p>

<p>"I want you to know our girls. This is Virginia,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
indicating Dum, "and this, Caroline,"
meaning Dee. I was rather amused at the fact
that earlier in the day he could not remember
their official names, as he called them. "I named
this one Virginia, thinking she was going to
have her mother's eyes, but the little monkey
changed them on me and in a twinkling turned
herself into a hazel-eyed monster," and poor
Zebedee forgot to cry any more and began to
laugh. "This is the much dreaded roommate,
Miss Page Allison, of Milton, Virginia. The
wild orgy which you so tactfully joined was in
honor of the discovery that this young lady was
the roommate."</p>

<p>"Well, girls, I am glad to see all of you and
hope we can be great friends. My name is Jane
Cox. I can't remember any one having the hardihood
to call me Jinny for some sixteen or seventeen
years. I haven't danced for at least ten
years. I don't know what the management or
the girls would think or say if they knew I had
cut up this way. I don't know what made me
do it. I came to the door to stop the racket
and when I saw Jeff Tucker whirling around<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
with three girls singing, 'Will you, won't you,
won't you, will you, will you join the dance?'
my discretion flew to the four winds. I just did
have sense enough left to shut the door. I forgot
I was an old maid, teaching singing in a
boarding school."</p>

<p>"It was simply splendid of you to come in and
help us out," exclaimed Dee. Dee was usually
the one who knew what to say and when to say
it. Some persons call it tact, but I have always
thought it was just a kind heart that made her
know what people wanted her to say. Cousin
Sue Lee was the same kind of natural-born social
wonder. "I think your voice is beautiful,
and how on earth did you happen to know our
tune?"</p>

<p>"Why, child, your father and I made up that
tune on a picnic once years before you were
born. Do you remember, Jeff, when we went to
Monticello, and how it rained? We composed
the tune and improvised a Lobster Quadrille to
cheer up the bedraggled crowd. How Virginia
did laugh! I haven't thought of that tune for
ages. Perhaps it is because I have not been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
with the kind of people who would enjoy 'Alice
in Wonderland.'"</p>

<p>"Zebedee has put us to sleep with it ever since
we were born," said Dum. "I mean the tune."</p>

<p>"And I have been reading Alice in Wonderland
ever since I was born," I ventured.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm certainly glad to meet some kindred
spirits at Gresham," said Miss Cox, "and
now, girls, I'm going to ask a great favor of the
three of you. I want you to keep to yourselves
that I broke loose as I did. I have hard enough
work as it is keeping order during study hour
when that task falls to me, and if the girls ever
found out that I was capable of such high-jinks,
I'd lose all control of them." We promised, but
I, for one, thought that the more human you find
your pastors and masters to be, the more apt
you are to want to make things easy for them.
Miss Jane Cox was much older than I, but she
had yet to learn that wisdom.</p>

<p>"We'll all promise," we declared in unison.</p>

<p>"But please break loose again, sometimes,
Jinny," begged Mr. Tucker. "The idea of your
calling yourself an old maid! I bet you are not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
thirty-five yet. I'm only thirty-six myself, and,
goodness knows, I am nothing but a kid!"</p>

<p>"Teaching is a very aging occupation," sighed
Miss Cox. "I don't mind the singing, but it's
teaching mathematics to the backward pupils
that adds ten years a season to my already full
years. Do your girls sing, Jeffry?"</p>

<p>"Not so's you can notice it. Dum, here, is
going to be a great sculptor; and Dee is uncertain
whether she wants to be a trained nurse or
a veterinary surgeon."</p>

<p>"Vet'rinary surgeon? Surely you wouldn't
let her go into such a profession?" exclaimed
Miss Cox with her twisted smile.</p>

<p>"Why not? I'll let my girls go into any profession
that appeals to them. Dum loves to
make mud pies and Dee loves to nurse sick puppies.
Both of them rather dirty arts, but 'Every
man to his taste.'"</p>

<p>Miss Cox had to leave us and go to attend to
various duties, but before going she assured Mr.
Tucker that she would take especial care of all
three of his girls. You can fancy what it meant
to me to be included. I almost called him Zebedee,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
but I was afraid it might make him feel like
the father of triplets, so I refrained.</p>

<p>It was almost time for the train which Mr.
Tucker was to catch, as he intended to take a
sleeper back to Richmond that night. I felt the
tactful thing for me to do would be to leave the
girls alone with their father, so I told him good-by
and went off to see how Annie Pore was
faring.</p>

<p>I found her sitting in a forlorn heap in one
of the neighboring rooms, her hat and jacket
still on; her disreputable telescope in the middle
of the room; and the expression on her face
suited to the tragic muse.</p>

<p>"Who's your cellmate, Annie?" said I, bursting
in on her.</p>

<p>"I don't know, but I know she will hate me."</p>

<p>"Hate you, indeed! No one could hate you.
Why don't you unpack and get your things in
order? I am going to stay with you until Mr.
Tucker leaves, so Tweedles can get a chance to
be alone with him for a while. I am rooming
with them, you know. Our room is quite near
you and we can all be real chummy."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>The rooms were all perfectly bare and bleak-looking:
white walls, white iron beds, curtainless
windows and carpetless floors. The pupils were
supposed to decorate their own rooms if they
wanted them decorated. Annie Pore had been
put into a two-girl room a bit smaller than the
one assigned to the Tuckers and me, but otherwise
exactly like it.</p>

<p>"I am dreading a roommate," sighed the girl.
"I have never slept in the room with any one
in my life."</p>

<p>"Neither have I, but I am crazy about it. Just
think what fun it will be to have some one to
talk to and giggle with."</p>

<p>I could not fancy giggling with Annie Pore
in her present melancholy frame of mind, but I
was sure that was a phase that would pass and
she would end by being as girlish as the next.
She had too keen a sense of humor to be lost in
gloom forever.</p>

<div class='center'>From Caroline Tucker to her father, Jeffry
Tucker.</div>

<div class="blockquot">

</div>

Dearest Zebedee:

<p>You would have to be your own daughter to
know how much you can be missed. After you
left the other day, Dum and I cried so much we
came mighty near getting sick, but Page Allison
came back and was so ridiculous in her description
of Annie Pore sitting up in the bus full of
Seniors with her cr&ecirc;pe hat cocked on one side,
that we got to laughing; and you know how easy
it is to be cheerful if someone only starts the ball
a-rolling. Page is splendid and takes the most
interest in life of anybody I ever saw. She
makes a lot of fun, but somehow it is never at
anyone but always with them. She loves dogs,
too, so I am sure to get on with her.</p>

<p>I do think it was wise in you, dearest Zebedee,
to make us have a roommate, since that roommate
happens to be Page, because she certainly
does do us good; and already I find I am trying
to "exert more self-control," as you say when
you are trying to be Mr. Tuckerish. She hates<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
blubbering and never cries except when the dogs
die or her father reads poetry to her. I tell her
that we don't usually cry, either, that is, we don't
bawl, but just leak a bit. She says just leaking
is rather fascinating and shows temperament,
and she wishes she wasn't so dry-eyed and could
express her emotions in such a graceful way.</p>

<p>Page has read a whole lot and knows reams
and quires of history, but never has studied any
French at all and has to go with the kids in
mathematics. She is real spunky about it,
though, and doesn't say a word about how humiliating
it must be to have to sit in a class with
children of twelve and even younger.</p>

<p>She can write Latin like a house afire, but
when she translates we can hardly keep from
giggling outright, as she uses the funny old pronunciation
that Grandpa Tucker does. It seems
she has learned Latin entirely from her father.
Miss Sears, the Latin teacher, is trying to get
her out of this pronunciation, but she compliments
her very much on her knowledge of English
derivatives. Page says that is the side of
Latin that interested her father and he consequently
taught it to her.</p>

<p>Dum and I have had only one serious set-to
since you left us. I licked her. I wish you
would send Dum a dollar box of plasticine. She
is restless sometimes and I know she is itching
to create, and if she had the mud she could do
it. Dum is being awfully good about holding on
to herself, and is just as nice and polite to Page
as can be, although she did vow and declare that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
she was going to make it so hot for any roommate
we got that the poor thing would have to
leave. Of course that was before we knew it
was going to be our luck to draw such a prize.
There's the bell, so good-by, dear old Zebedeedlums.</p>

My darling Zebedee:

<p>Dee wrote yesterday so I waited until to-day,
although she declared she was not writing the
kind of thing to you that I was going to. I don't
see how she knew what I was going to write

<p>There is one thing I want to say and that is:
"the old man always knows best." A roommate
is a great institution when she is as bully as
Page Allison. I was awfully afraid Dee was
going to be rude, but she hasn't been a bit. As
for me, I have been a little tin angel. You can
ask Dee if I haven't.</p>

<p>I am mighty sorry for Dee. She not only
misses you just as much as I do, but she misses
old Brindle almost as much as she does you. I
don't see why they won't let a bulldog go to
boarding school. I asked Dee if she gave you
any more directions about how to take care of
Brindle, and she said she hadn't even mentioned
him she was so afraid of splashing on her letter.</p>

<p>Your friend Miss Cox has been in to see us
and was just as jolly as could be, but when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
other girls are around she treats us like perfect
strangers. The truth of the matter is she is
afraid of girls and does not understand them,
nor do they understand her. I got that from
Page, who is very analytical. Page says if she
would let herself go she would be the most popular
teacher in school, but as it is, while she is
not unpopular, she is not regarded at all. She
is awfully interesting but the girls don't know it.
They know she has a good voice and teaches
with good method but she might as well be a phonograph
for all the human interest they have
in her. She is coach for the backward and wayward
in Math. I believe Page Allison will have
to have her, and I bet on Page for drawing her
out.</p>

<p>I tell you that girl has done wonders with
Annie Pore. Every time she finds her crying
she makes her laugh, and you know no one but
old Zebedee can laugh and cry at the same time
without going into hysterics. Right to her face
she calls her "Melancholy Dane" and "Old Rain
in the Face" and all kinds of ridiculous names,
and Annie simply has to smile. There is one
thing about Page: you can always know she is
going to say what she's got to say right to your
face. Usually when people are that way their
conversation is "yea, yea, and nay, nay," but
Page is not that way a bit.</p>

<p>Dee and I have had only one bout and then
Dee knocked me out. It was a funny thing the
way I let down my guard, but I got to thinking
about Dee's dimple in her chin and how some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
day I was going to make a stunning bust of her.
You see Dee looks mighty handsome when she
boxes, with her head thrown back, her neck like
a column. I had sure got her going that day
and she had backed way up in the corner, when
the idea of making the bust took possession of
me&mdash;well, Dee made a stunning bust of me,
that's all. She tapped me on the nose and drew
the claret.</p>

<p>The row was all about you. Dee said you
must be pretty near middle-aged and I said she
was all the way a plumb idiot, you were no such
thing and never would be. The fact that she
tapped me does not prove that you are or ever
will be any such thing. Page came in at the crucial
moment and was somewhat shocked to see us
boxing, and was broken up over the gore; but
when she heard what the row was about, she
sympathized with me and offered to put on the
gloves and fight it out with Dee; but she decided
in her amusing way to argue it out instead.</p>

<p>She said: "If the pen is mightier than the
sword, surely the tongue is mightier than a pair
of boxing gloves." She proved to Dee's perfect
satisfaction that age was a matter of temperament
and that yours was eternal youth. Dee
was convinced and offered the <i>amende honorable</i>,
confessing herself beaten in argument. I
begin to think trial by combat not such a good
way of settling things, after all. It seems to me
a quiet debate is much the better way.</p>

<p>Write to us soon. I heard one of the Seniors
say you were the most attractive-looking man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
she ever saw. She thought you were our big
brother and meant for me to hear it and of
course wanted me to repeat it to you. Good-by,
my darling old Zebedeedidlums. I am sorry
I made you cry twice on the day you brought
us up here.</p>

My dear Father:

<p>I am writing to you at my earliest opportunity.
I made the journey without any mishaps
and in great comfort. I was astonished to find
how luxurious traveling by rail is. I shall have
to confess to you that I talked to some persons
I met on the train. They were all of them going
to Gresham and were very kind to me. I
found myself conversing with them before I remembered
your admonitions to be very careful
about making acquaintances. I know in England
it is very bad form, but I felt somehow it
would have been much worse form to hold myself
aloof when they were one and all so kind
to me.</p>

<p>The Institute of Gresham is admirable in
every particular. My instruction has been so
thorough, thanks to your unceasing efforts, that
I find I can take a very good stand. I have
not divulged that an Oxford graduate has been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
my teacher. I am well up in Algebra, Latin and
French, although my French accent is not all
that it should be.</p>

<p>Miss Cox, the singing teacher, takes a great
interest in my voice but evidently has no personal
feeling for me. I am very grateful to
you for the sacrifices you have made to send me
to boarding school, and am endeavoring to take
advantage of every opportunity to perfect my
education.</p>

</div>
My dear old Father:

<p>I can hardly believe it is only a few days since
I left Bracken. It seems ages and eons. I have
a million things to tell you. I made friends with
some delightful people on the train, Mr. Jeffry
Tucker and his twin daughters, Dum and Dee.
Mr. Tucker says he knows you; and my eyes
were so like yours he came mighty near giving
me the fraternity grip. He is the youngest man
to be grown up and have almost grown-up
daughters I ever saw. Their mother is dead,
too. So many mothers seem to be dead.</p>

<p>We made friends with another girl on the
train, Annie Pore from Price's Landing. She
had never been on the train before, but although
she seemed terribly shy and was dressed in a
most pathetic get-up, still she had all the bearing a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and carriage of a <i>grande dame</i>. She is a
half-orphan, too, and I have a kind of idea that
her father is not to say so intimate with his
daughter as some other fathers who shall be
nameless. She has been writing to her paternal
parent for the last hour, and she actually copied
the letter and seemed to be writing with as much
care as though it had to be handed in. You
don't want me to write that way to you, do you?</p>

<p>Gresham is splendid. It is a beautiful building,
red brick with great white columns, giving
it the look of a modern Parthenon. It is on top
of a hill overlooking the little town and has a
beautiful lawn with great chestnut trees and
oaks. But best of all is the view of the mountains.
When it is clear they seem quite close,
almost as though we could walk to them, and at
other times they disappear altogether.</p>

<p>The first day or two the girls seemed to think
if they did not do a lot of bawling and blubbering
some one might think they did not love their
homes. Some of them cried because they could
not help it, but some of them, I verily believe,
rubbed onions in their eyes like the heartless sisters
in "Beauty and the Beast." I know no home
could be more beautiful than Bracken and I'll
wager anything that there isn't a dad in the
world better or more beloved than mine. And
was there ever a mammy like mine? I'm not
even mentioning the dogs, although they are not
the least of my blessings. And still, not a visible
tear have I shed.</p>

<p>The first morning when I waked up in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
strange room and stared at the blank bare wall,
it seemed to me as though I simply could not
stand it. I was dreaming about Mammy Susan.
I thought she was pouring hot water into my
tub again. My roommates were still asleep,
having wept themselves into a state of coma.
(I haven't told you that I am rooming with Dum
and Dee Tucker and I like it a lot.) Well, I
got up and went to the bathroom and had the
coldest bath I ever had in my life and then I
dressed in a hurry. I felt as though I must get
out before any one saw me. If I could have a
little run, maybe I could stave off the great wave
of homesickness that was going to swallow me
up in a minute. I raced along the corridor.</p>

<p>I got onto a covered walk connecting the dormitory
with the main building, and there serene
and beautiful were the mountains stretched before
me. I didn't want to cry any more. A feeling
of deep peace and happiness came to me. I
chanted aloud: "I will look unto the hills from
whence cometh my help," etc. You mustn't think
I don't love you and Mammy Susan just as much
as ever, for I do; but I am having a good time
and am going to learn a few things, and am going
to make loads and loads of friends.</p>

<p>My love to all the dear dogs and please give
them an extra bone for me. And tell dear
Mammy Susan that all of us on the train would
have starved to death if she hadn't put up all
that good lunch. I'll tell you about what I am
studying in my next letter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good-by,</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE FOUNDLING.</div>


<p>"Well, Miss Peyton is some mobilizer," sighed
Dee as she snuggled down in her bed after our
first study hall had been lived through at
Gresham. "Just to think, here we are hard at
work when we have been here only two days."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad, for one," said Dum. "If they
work us hard enough, we won't get Zebedee-sick.
That's what Dee and I call homesick. Wherever
Zebedee is, is home for us."</p>

<p>"My Father and Bracken and Mammy Susan
and the dogs are so mixed up in my mind that
I can't tell what or which or whom I miss most,"
and I scrambled into bed in a great hurry just
as the bell rang to warn us that lights must be
out in five minutes. I had not been twenty-four
hours with other girls before I had learned many
things that girls know. One of them was that
the last one up has the chores to do, such as raising<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the window at the bottom and pulling it
down at the top, a mighty chilly performance
when clothed in nothing but a nightgown; also,
the tardy one has the light to put out.</p>

<p>"Oh, you foxy creatures!" cried Dum. "I bet
you haven't cleaned your teeth, you've been in
such a hurry to beat me to bed."</p>

<p>"'Deed we have," we declared, "while you
were calling on Annie Pore."</p>

<p>"You haven't said your prayers, then," persisted
Dum.</p>

<p>"I have," I said. But Dee had neglected this
means of grace and had to crawl out of her nice,
warm bed; and she and Dum knelt together.
There was silence for about three minutes; then
Dum bounced into bed and pulled the covers up
to her square chin. There she lay, with eyes
closed.</p>

<p>"Dum Tucker, you skipped something. I don't
believe you said a single thing but 'NowIlayme,'"
and Dee stood over her sister like an
avenging angel.</p>

<p>"What's it to you?" yawned Dum. "That's a
matter between me and my conscience. Open<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the window; and turn out the light; and crawl
into bed before our room gets reported."</p>

<p>"Well, it was a matter between my conscience
and me whether I said my prayers at all; and
you went and butt in on us. Now you take that
toploftical stand about you and your conscience!
Well, you and your conscience can just lie on
the floor together." With which tirade, Dee
yanked Dum and all her bed clothes out on the
floor. She then whisked off the light and, quickly
raising the window, jumped into bed.</p>

<p>I wondered what would be the outcome of this
battle and if it would have to be settled according
to the Tuckers' code of honor: a duel with
boxing gloves. But just then there was a sharp
rap on the door.</p>

<p>"Less noise, please," said a determined voice
outside, "or I shall have to report 117 to the
principal."</p>

<p>Dum lay on the floor convulsed with giggles.
"Sh-h&mdash;." I warned. "Be careful, or we'll all
have to write pages from the dictionary for two
hours."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"You won't have to, surely, when Dum and I
made all the racket," whispered Dee.</p>

<p>"The teacher said '117,' and that means me,
too. Can you get back into bed? Is the foot
untucked?"</p>

<p>"I believe I can if I don't start giggling
again," and Dum began to squirm out of the
covers.</p>

<p>"Let me help," said the penitent Dee, and
Dum was soon back in her cot and silence
reigned supreme. After a while I heard Dum
whisper:</p>

<p>"Say, Dee, I did skip. Conscience bids me confess
to thee."</p>

<p>"Well, Dum, I'll give it to you that you and
your conscience are perfect gentlemen," said
Dee admiringly.</p>

<p>"Thanks awfully," yawned Dum. "I know
one thing, I'm a mighty sleepy gentleman;" and
in a trice the quiet breathing from the disheveled
bed told that Dum and her conscience were at
rest.</p>

<p>There were constant surprises in store for one
who shared a room with the Tucker twins. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
certainly had the gift of infinite variety in the
kind of scrapes they could get themselves into.
They usually got out of scrapes as easily as they
got into them by a certain frankness and directness
that would disarm Miss Peyton herself.
They didn't break rules, because they did things
that nobody had ever thought of making rules
about. The principal at Gresham was not so
farseeing as the teacher in "Mary Had a Little
Lamb," who seems to have made a rule about
lambs in school:</p>

<div class='poem'>
It followed her to school one day,<br />
Which was against the rule.<br />
It made the children laugh and play<br />
To see a lamb in school.<br />
</div>

<p>One day when we were taking a sedate walk,
the school out in full force with two teachers to
keep order along the blue-coated, black-hatted
lines, we saw by the roadside a little kitten, so
young its eyes were hardly open.</p>

<p>"Poor little foundling!" "I wonder where it
came from!" "I'd like to pick him up!" ejaculated
several of the girls, but Dee Tucker was the one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
who acted. She was bringing up the rear with
Miss Sears, the Latin teacher. As they were
passing the forlorn little feline, Miss Sears
stepped forward to admonish a couple who were
talking too loudly. Dee stooped and quickly
scooped into her muff the poor pussy. No one
saw her and kitty very considerately said nothing.
He lay there warm and contented, dreaming
he was back with his soft, loving mother,
and forgetting the rude hand that had put him
into a bag with his brothers and sisters. The
bag had had a merciful hole, and he, being the
runt of the family, had fallen through before the
proposed drowning came off.</p>

<p>We marched on, all unconscious of the addition
to our ranks. When we got back to school
and went up to our room to take off our hats,
etc., I noticed that Dee had very shining eyes
and her dimple seemed to be deeper, but she did
not divulge to Dum and me what she had up her
sleeve, or rather her muff. I also noticed at supper
that she swiped some bread and very adroitly
concealed it in her middy blouse. She also
very cleverly called the attention of every one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
at our table to the autumn moon, that was peeping
into the dining room window, and while they
were looking the other way, she filled a little vial
with milk from her glass.</p>

<p>Naturally I said nothing, but adopted the
watchful, waiting attitude, certain that sooner
or later I'd find out what Dee was up to. And
I did, all right.</p>

<p>After supper we had an hour before study hall
which we usually spent in the gymnasium dancing.
Dum and Dee had undertaken to teach Annie
Pore and me the new dances. All dances were
new to poor Annie and me. I could cut the pigeon
wing and dance "Goin' to Church," which is a negro
classic (but the Tango and Maxixe with all of
the intricate steps and side-stepping seemed very
difficult). But I must learn, and learn I did. As
for Annie, her sense of rhythm was so great that
she took to dancing as a duck does to water.
She had to get over a certain self-consciousness
that was her ruling fault, but when the Victrola
was started in one of the tunes that would make
a dead darkey want to get up and pat, why,
Annie would forget all about Annie and her ill-fitting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
clothes and would sway to the music with
the utmost abandon.</p>

<p>I believe I have forgotten to tell whom Annie
got for a roommate. It was none other than
Josephine Barr, the good-natured, dressy Senior,
for whom Miss Sayre felt so sorry because of
her great wealth. I fancy Jo, as we soon called
her, was not very well pleased at first at having
to share a room with such a seemingly dismal
person; but it was either Annie or Mabel Binks,
as all the other rooms were filled and Jo had not
registered in time to have much choice.</p>

<p>She couldn't bear Mabel Binks; and she did
feel sorry for the poor little new girl who seemed
so ready to dissolve into tears. Jo was the best
old thing in the world, with a heart as big as
all outdoors and an optimistic nature that was
bound to influence Annie and make her more
cheerful; at the same time, Annie's breeding and
careful speech had its good effect on the husky
Jo. Before the year was up, they were as intimate
as a Senior and Sophomore could be.</p>

<p>On that famous evening which was afterward
known as the "Kitten Evening," Dee<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
kept disappearing between dances. She would
come back, flushed and a little troubled-looking,
but would go on with the dance with a do-or-die
expression. Study hour in the assembly hall
from eight to ten and then half an hour to get
to bed before the bell rang for lights out: that
was the order of procedure. As we studied, I
noticed how Dee kept fidgeting and twisting.
Dum noticed it, too, and the fidgets seemed to be
catching. We were on our honor not to speak
during study hour, and of course that settled
the matter for the Tuckers and me. Dee could
squirm herself into a bowknot and Dum and I
could die of curiosity, and still honor forbade
our making a sign to find out what was the
matter.</p>

<p>I never spent such a long and unprofitable
two hours in my life. I tried to concentrate my
attention on my lessons, but it was impossible
with Dee at the desk in front of me never still a
minute.</p>

<p>"The bell at last!" exclaimed Dee.</p>

<p>"Well, your lessons have been Reeling and
Writhing, Dee Tucker. I never saw such a wiggler<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
in my life." But Dee was off like a whirlwind,
without a word to Dum and me. She
didn't even take her books with her or gather
up the scattered papers that were strewn over
her desk. We mercifully saved her some demerits
by putting things in order for her.</p>

<p>"What do you reckon is up with Dee?" said
Dum anxiously. "She is either brewing some
mischief or is already in a scrape."</p>

<p>We found the door to 117 carefully closed and
Dee already in bed. How she ever managed to
get in so rapidly, I could not see, unless she
followed the plan of "Diddle, diddle dumpling,
my son, John."</p>

<p>"Now, Dee Tucker, what is the matter with
you?" begged Dum anxiously.</p>

<p>"The matter with me?" said Dee with feigned
coolness. "Nothing on earth, my dear sister.
What should be the matter with me? I am simply
sleepy and thought I would get into bed."</p>

<p>"How about your teeth and your prayers?"</p>

<p>"Cleaned 'em and said 'em," said Dee laconically,
and she turned over rather gingerly, I noticed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and pretended to have fallen into a deep
sleep.</p>

<p>"She won't be able to keep it to herself very
long," whispered Dum to me. "If it is any fun,
she can't be low enough not to share it; and if
it is trouble of some sort, she is sure to let us in
on it. I'll take the motto of Prosper le Gai:
'I bide my time.'"</p>

<p>Respecting Dee's evident desire for silence,
Dum and I went very quietly to bed and had the
light out long before it was time.</p>

<p>A knock at the door! "Come in," called Dum.
It was Annie Pore, very apologetic at disturbing
us.</p>

<p>"It is ten minutes before lights out bell. I
had no idea you had all gone to bed. I was worried
about Dee. Is she all right? She looked
so feverish."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, she's all right; just sleepy," said
Dum politely. "Thank you all the same, Annie."</p>

<p>Annie softly closed the door. I heard strange
sounds from Dee's bed but could not tell whether
she was laughing or crying.</p>

<p>Another knock!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come in," a little wearily from Dum.</p>

<p>Miss Jane Cox this time!</p>

<p>"Oh, girls, excuse me! I did not know you
were in bed, I was a little anxious about Dee."
A snore from Dee's bed, rather melodramatic
in tone. "She seemed so upset during study
hour. I was on duty and I did not know whether
she needed castor oil or a demerit." The snoring
stopped. The snorer was evidently deliberating.</p>

<p>"I think she is all right now, Miss Cox," I
ventured. "She went right off to bed as soon
as study hour was over. Maybe she won't have
to have either, demerit or oil. My private opinion
is she had a flea down her back, but she says
she was just tired and sleepy." A gratified
snore from Dee and Miss Cox with a little
snicker went to her room.</p>

<div class='poem2'>
"Night, Sable Goddess, from her ebon throne,<br />
Now stretches forth a leaden scepter o'er a slumbering world."<br />
</div>

<p>Lights out bell had rung, and the girls all
along the corridors in Carter Hall had gone to
bed and to sleep. I had a feeling of impending<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
something, not necessarily evil, but excitement,
at least. Dum was breathing gently and regularly
like a sleeping infant. Dee stirred every
now and then and occasionally muttered an unintelligible
something. I dozed but waked with
a start.</p>

<p>"Mieuw&mdash;mieuw&mdash;mieuw!" came in a heart-rending
wail from Dee's bed.</p>

<p>"Shhhh-shhhh! Poor ittle titty puss! Don't
you cwy, honey child! Shhh&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mieuw&mdash;mieuw-mieuw-mieuw!!!!" More
subdued endearments from Dee. Dum slept on,
but I heard a door open way down the hall!
Some teacher, with sharp ears, no doubt.</p>

<p>"Dee," I whispered, "put your little finger in
its mouth and let it suck until that busybody
down the hall goes back into her room." There
was the sound of a door closing.</p>

<p>"What is your advice, Page?"</p>

<p>"Have you anything for it to eat?"</p>

<p>"Bread and milk, but it won't eat."</p>

<p>"Of course not, it is too little. Did you warm
the milk?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"No, how could I with no stove?" One of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
rules of the institution was: no alcohol stoves.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute. I've got a candle that
Mammy Susan put in my bag in case of accidents."
How I blessed the kind old woman who
had thought of everything. "Them newfangled
lights may be mighty fine but if they 'cide not to
wuck some night, a good ole tallow can'le 'll come
in mighty handy, chile, also some saftest
matches," she had said as she overrode all my
objections and tucked the life-saving candle and
matches in my already overworked grip.</p>

<p>I got up, donned slippers and dressing gown,
gently closed the window, as the night was decidedly
frosty, and found the matches and candle.
We did not dare to light the electric light
because of the transom over the door. Pussy
might at any moment let out another wail, and
then the wakeful teacher, seeing the light, would
make for our room. In feeling for the table, I
touched Dum's foot and she waked with a start.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Dee? Are you sick?"
And Dum sat up in bed.</p>

<p>"Shhh&mdash;No, Dum, she's not sick but the little
kitty is hungry," I whispered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"The <i>what</i> is hungry?"</p>

<p>"Not so loud, Dum dear, please! It's just a
poor, miserable little foundling of a kitty puss
that I simply could not leave by the roadside.
I've got it in bed with me here."</p>

<p>"Oh, Caroline Tucker! A nasty little cat in
bed with you? What would Zebedee say?" and
Dum sniffed the air disdainfully.</p>

<p>"He would say just what I say, Virginia
Tucker, that it is a mighty funny thing that you,
who were in line before me and must have seen
the poor little wretched kitten first, didn't feel it
your duty to rescue it from its misery. I am
ashamed of you, belonging to the S. P. C. A.,
too," and Dee gave her little charge a brand new
finger to suck.</p>

<p>Things were looking rather serious: Dum and
Dee calling one another Virginia and Caroline
and that in no modulated tones; and the candle
making such a bright light that I expected every
minute to hear a teacher rapping on our door.</p>

<p>"Now, look here, Tweedles, both of you stop
your fussing and 'tend to the business in hand.
You can fight it out to-morrow, but for Heaven's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
sake, put all of your surplus energy now on
getting the kitten fed and quiet and 117 not in
a deluge of demerits. Dum, get up and pin two
middy ties over the transom."</p>

<p>Dum obediently carried out my instructions
while I warmed the milk that Dee had purloined
from the supper table over the blessed candle. I
sweetened it a little and diluted it with water.
I warmed it in Dee's silver pin-tray, as we had
no pan of any sort.</p>

<p>"Dip your finger in here, Dee, and let the kitten
taste it so it can realize succor is near. It is
lots too young to lap and will have to suck a
rag."</p>

<p>Dum tore up an old handkerchief for me and
in a little while kitty was tugging away for dear
life, one end of the bit of cambric in its pink flannel
mouth and the other in the pin-tray of milk.</p>

<p>Dum was soon won over to the helpless little
thing. "It is sweet, Dee, I declare; let me hold
it a minute."</p>

<p>Dee magnanimously handed it over to her sister
who held the pin-tray very carefully and let
kitty feed as tenderly as any young mother. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
soon got its fill and curled up and purred "just
like a fairy buzz-saw," Dum declared.</p>

<p>"To think of a tiny cat like that knowing how
to purr!" exclaimed Dee.</p>

<p>"To think of a tiny cat like that having such
enormous fleas on it," shuddered Dum. "Here,
take the beastie, I'm going back to bed before I
get full of 'em."</p>

<p>"Yes, they are something awful," sighed Dee,
"I am literally eaten alive."</p>

<p>"Poor old Dee! Change your nightgown and
leave your bed to the pussy and come snuggle in
with me," said Dum.</p>

<p>Pussy slept very well in Dee's bed, waking
only about every two hours and mewing for
nourishment. Dee and I would get wearily up,
warm the milk and administer.</p>

<p>"Oh, who could be a cat with kittens?" sighed
Dee.</p>

<p>Morning finally came and the problem of what
to do with our adopted child had to be faced.</p>

<p>"Do you know what I'd do if I were you,
Dee? I'd go right to Miss Peyton and tell her
all about it. I'll go with you. She would sympathize<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
with you, I really believe, and help you
find a home for pussy," I said.</p>

<p>"I'll go, too," cried Dum.</p>

<p>Miss Peyton was fine. She seemed to think
Dee had merely been imprudent, not at all
naughty. She agreed with Dee that it was a
strange thing that the whole line of girls and
teachers should have passed the little waif by.</p>

<p>"Girls, I am proud and happy that you should
have felt I was the person to confide in. If
all the school could only understand that I am
their friend and not just the principal and dealer
in demerits. Of course you can't keep the kitten
in your room, but I will see that a good home
is found for it with someone who will take the
trouble to feed it until it can lap for itself. I
think I know exactly the right person in the
village."</p>

<p>We went from the principal's office in very
happy and exalted states of mind.</p>

<p>"Isn't she wonderful?" exclaimed Dee.
"Wasn't she splendid to us?"</p>

<p>"She was fine," enthused Dum. "I am certainly
relieved."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>I said to myself: "Miss Peyton was awfully
nice, but it is plain to be seen she is fond of cats.
I wonder how she would have felt if it had been
an orphan snake or an abused Billy-goat!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>KITTY'S FOSTER-FATHER.</div>


<p>Tweedles and I were excused from the Gym
exercises that afternoon with the request that
we meet Miss Peyton in her office at three
o'clock. We were there on time, you may be
sure, and Dee had the kitty all done up in a shoe
box ready for the trip. We had christened him
Oliver Twist, because he kept on "hollering for
more" all the weary night.</p>

<p>Miss Peyton laughed until the tears rolled
down her cheeks over the description of our
trials during the night. When we found out
that she did not think it was so terribly wicked
of Dee, we felt we could tell her everything, even
the middy ties over the transom and the fleas in
Dee's bed.</p>

<p>"You poor girls must be nearly dead, aren't
you?" she asked kindly.</p>

<p>"Page and I feel right scrooch-eyed, but after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the first feeding, Dum slept through it all,"
laughed Dee. "I have more sympathy than ever
for poor Zebedee. That's what we call our
Father, you know, Miss Peyton. He had to bring
up Dum and me on bottles as our little Mother
died when we were tiny babies. If one kitten
could keep two girls awake most of the night
heating milk for it, don't you fancy two twins,
like Dum and me, could keep one man awake all
the time?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you have a nurse?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Of course we did, all kinds and colors, but
Dum and I wouldn't drink unless Zebedee gave
us the bottles. He says he was afraid the nurse
might not be sanitary and trusted no one but
himself to fix the milk."</p>

<p>"Poor old Zebedee!" sighed Dum, her eyes
filling. "I don't see how we could have been so
mean to him."</p>

<p>We had started on our quest for a friend for
kitty, Miss Peyton leading the way down toward
the village. She seemed to be enjoying the little
outing as much as we were.</p>

<p>"Your Father must be very patient," she said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
putting her arm in Dum's when she saw the hazel
eyes filling at the thought of her Father.</p>

<p>"Well, the funny part of it is, he is not one
bit patient except with Dee and me. Do you
know, once he got dreadfully mad with the telephone
girl who kept on cutting him off when he
was in the midst of some most important business
that could not wait, and every time he would
try to get connection again, the operator would
say 'Line busy.' Now he knew the line was not
busy and the person on the other end was just
as anxious to be got as he was to get him, and,
as I was saying, he got so mad he pulled the telephone
out by the roots."</p>

<p>"Well, that was, to say the least, impulsive,"
and Miss Peyton laughed like any schoolgirl.</p>

<p>"You mustn't think Zebedee is bad-tempered,"
put in Dee. "He's got the sweetest disposition
in the world. He's just quick-tempered. He has
learned to control himself wonderfully but you
know he is real young yet."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," said Miss Peyton solemnly.</p>

<p>"Tell us whom you are going to get to be
kitty's foster father, Miss Peyton," I said, purposely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
changing the subject. Not that I did not
take the keenest interest in everything pertaining
to Mr. Tucker, but I could see that the twins
were both getting leaky, and it did seem a pity
to have a cloud cast over our delightful walk
with Miss Peyton.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I will," she said, giving me an approving
nod. "It is dear old Captain Pat Leahy.
I hope you girls will like him as much as I do.
He is sure to like you. Of course he may not
be able to keep the little thing and then I don't
know what we will do. Anyhow, let's not borrow
trouble. I know the dear man will do it
for me if he possibly can. When I first came
to Gresham as a pupil&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, were you a pupil here?" we exclaimed in
one breath.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, I came here before I went to
college. Gresham had not such a grand building
then and accommodated only about fifty girls.
It was more like a home school. Captain Leahy
was then conductor on the local train and took
an especial interest in the Gresham girls. I shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
never forget how good he was to me on my first
trip. I was lonesome and shy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You, shy! Oh, Miss Peyton, were you,
really?"</p>

<p>"I should say I was. Why, Annie Pore is
brazen beside what I was as a child. Captain
Leahy sat by me between stations and with his
ready Irish tongue cheered me up immensely.
He treated me to peanuts and made me laugh and
gave me a new outlook on life. The poor fellow
lost a leg in a railroad accident about ten
years ago, and ever since then has kept the gate
where the track crosses the main street of
Gresham."</p>

<p>"Does he like cats?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he adores them. That is the great
bond of sympathy between us. He loves cats
and he loves flowers. He also has a great fondness
for young people. Here we are," and Miss
Peyton pointed out the gate-house where her old
friend lived.</p>

<p>It was just an ordinary little square box of
a house painted the pumpkin yellow that railroads
are so partial to, but all around it were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
window boxes, some of them filled with geraniums,
some with Norway spruces and English
ivy. A moon flower had completely covered one
side of the little house, but the frost had touched
the big leaves and they were dropping off one
by one.</p>

<p>A grizzled old man with a long red beard and
a peg leg was digging around the geraniums as
we approached. "Captain, I have brought some
of my girls to meet you," said Miss Peyton, holding
out her hand to the old man and introducing
us.</p>

<p>"And I am that proud to meet all of yez; and
so will me cats be. The poor critters long for
some petticoats to cuddle oop to. A peg leg is
but cold comfort to a pussy when she is hankering
for some women folk," and with a hearty
laugh the old fellow stumped to the door of his
little gate-house and called to the cats. Out they
came, seven in all and a motley crew. The Captain
was very democratic and not particular
about the pedigree of his friends.</p>

<p>"All cats are aristocratic if you just give 'em<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
a chance," he would declare when some cat snob
would suggest that he go in for pure breeds.</p>

<p>Six of the cats came to him and rubbed their
backs against his good leg; but the seventh, a
large gray one with a mournful look in her eyes,
began to sharpen her claws on a long strip of
sand paper he had tacked to his wooden leg. We
burst out laughing. It was the most comical
thing I had ever seen.</p>

<p>"A little invintion of me own. There are no
trees handy for the poor critters to sharpen their
claws on and I find this device saves me furniture
many a scratch." He stooped and laid his
hand lovingly on the mournful one, but she
arched her back and moved over to the protection
of Dee's skirts.</p>

<p>"What, schtill angry wid me, poor Bett? I
had to have her kittens drowned, all but one,
and she can't forgive me, not that I blame her.
But what am I to do, Miss Peyton? Me house
is schmall and Bett is that prolific she could furnish
kittens for all the ould maids in Christendom
in little or no toime."</p>

<p>"Well, it is a problem, Captain Leahy, but I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
am sorry for Bett. Aren't there enough old
maids in Gresham to help you out some?" Miss
Peyton stooped down and picked up the poor
bereaved mother who nestled comfortably in her
arms and began to purr loudly.</p>

<p>"The demand doesn't come oop to Bett's supply,
niver in the world," laughed the old man.
"But what am I thinking of keeping yez waiting
out here so long? Come in, come in!" I
have never heard such a rich, delicious voice as
Captain Leahy's; and his brogue was as soft as
the purr of his cats.</p>

<p>"Before we go in, I might as well tell you
what has brought us to you especially, Captain,"
said Miss Peyton.</p>

<p>"What? You must schnatch me from me
Fool's Paradise? I was after thinking all the
time you had come to see the ould man himself,"
and his eyes twinkled mischievously.</p>

<p>"So we did, dear Captain. We have come to
see you because you are you, and we need your
help," answered Miss Peyton with her engaging
smile that somehow made one feel that her
way was the best way.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, sitting is as cheap as standing and I
want this peg leg to last as long as I do. It is
astonishing how fast they wear out. Come in,
come in, and tell me what it is you want me to
help yez about," and he led the way into his
little house.</p>

<p>It did not seem so small when you got in because
it was so orderly. The lower berth from
a wrecked Pullman served him as seat by day
and bed by night. The very smallest cooking
stove imaginable, almost a doll baby size, polished
like the boots of a dandy, was at one side.
Over it was a shelf with some blue and white
china on it, and under the shelf a few cooking
utensils and a dish pan and biscuit board.</p>

<p>"Sit down, sit down, and while the kittle is
biling for tay, I can listen to your trroobles."
We seated ourselves on the Pullman seat while
the dear old man busied himself with the tea
kettle. Bett, the bereaved mother, still nestled
in Miss Peyton's arms, but after a moment she
wriggled out and got into the box behind the
stove. "You'd better look after your baby, you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
ould rip. I'm thinking these ladies are that fond
of cats that they might be making off wid it."</p>

<p>"That's just it, Captain Leahy, these ladies
are fond of cats, one of them especially," indicating
Dee. "So fond of them that yesterday
when the whole school was out on the Valley Road
taking the dignified walk that is required, what
should Miss Caroline Tucker do but rescue a
poor little lost kitten, mewing by the roadside,
carry it home in her muff without teacher or fellow
pupil seeing her, and actually take it to bed
with her. But, girls, you tell Captain Leahy
about it yourselves," which we did at Miss Peyton's
command.</p>

<p>He enjoyed the prank as much as Miss Peyton
and laughed until the blue and white china
danced on the little shelf.</p>

<p>"And now I know very well what ye have
come for. Ye want me to take a boarder."</p>

<p>"Oh, will you, please?" implored Dee.</p>

<p>Bett, having nourished her lone offspring, now
carried it in her mouth for Miss Peyton's inspection,
and Dee, seeing her, jumped up in great
excitement, dropping the box she had been holding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
so carefully and waking up Oliver Twist in
the fall. "Look, look! Bett's kitten looks just
like Oliver! I thought it was him at first." Dee
was excited and we all excused her English.
Oliver began to cry aloud and Bett tore around
like one demented.</p>

<p>"Well, Bett, old girl, your baby has been restored
to yez. If this don't beat all! On the
Valley Road, yesterday, you say? I told that
boy to be careful of the hole in the bag, that the
runt might fall through it, and so he did. You
call him Oliver, you say? Well, that is a handsome
name for such a poor mite, but maybe it
will give him some ambition to grow oop to it.
There's an ould saying: 'If you escape drowning,
you'll live to be hanged.' I hope not, Oliver,
I hope not."</p>

<p>Now Bett, having one of her babies back, forgave
her master and rubbed herself against his
good leg; and then such another washing as she
did give Oliver before she considered him fit
to get into the box that she called home!</p>

<p>The kettle was boiling and the tea soon steeping
in the pretty teapot. The Captain put up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
a little table exactly like the ones on the train
and we had the merriest kind of a party.</p>

<p>"Your cats are so fat, Captain, what do you
feed them on?" asked Dee, in her element with
two cats in her lap.</p>

<p>"An ould frind of mine, who is schteward on
a diner saves me all the schraps and the cats live
high, higher than their master, by a long shot.
But do you know the windfall I have had lately,
Miss Peyton?"</p>

<p>"No; do tell me. I am so glad of any good
fortune that comes to you, Captain."</p>

<p>"Bless your schwate heart for thim words!
Well, I have always had a hard toime about my
shoes since I lost me limb. Such an accumulation
of rights as you never saw wid no one wanting
of thim and no place to put thim and feeling
it was to say the least a sin to be throwing thim
away, when no doubt there was somewhere in
the worrld a man who had lost his lift leg who
would give anything for thim. Well, I came on
this advertisement in a Washington paper: 'A
man who has lost his left leg would like to get
into communication with one who has lost his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
right. 11&frac12; E.' I knew soon as I clapped eyes
on it that some poor fellow was in exactly me
own dilimma. I did get into communication wid
him and now I am no longer trying to find a
place for the right shoes I have no use for and
on the other hand I have enough of the lifts to
last me a lifetime. 11&frac12; E's too, exactly my
size."</p>

<p>"Well, that was a windfall surely," said Miss
Peyton. ("More like a footfall," muttered
Dum.) "But, Captain, I thought you were going
to buy a fine jointed leg with a foot and then
you would need your own right shoes."</p>

<p>"Oh, I have given oop the notion. You see
my cats would miss the peg something awful,
wid no place to sharpen their little claws; and
thin I have found a poor widdy woman living
down the track a piece and the right leg of me
pants do come in so handy for the poor thing
to make schuits for her little byes. It would
seem a sin to use that warm cloth to cover cork,
whin some poor little lamb is shivering in the
cold."</p>

<p>"Ah, Captain, always thinking how you can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
be good to children and cats," said Miss Peyton.</p>

<p>Then with many thanks to the old Irishman
for his hospitality and his kindness and the
good time he had given us, we took our departure.
I noticed that Dum, who had been very
quiet and whose eyes had been misty several
times, especially when the Captain told of the
fate of his trouser legs, stepped back into the
little house and I heard her whisper to the old
man: "Please, Captain, take this half dollar and
buy some toys for the little lambs who wear the
pant legs." I happened to know it was the whole
of her week's allowance, too.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>ABOUT MATHEMATICS AND ME.</div>


<p>I was a very difficult pupil to place, having
been overeducated in some subjects and absolutely
neglected in others. I might have gone
with the seniors in English and History; was
normal in Latin, that is, sophomore, where girls
of my age were put; was just beginning French;
and had to go with the kids in Mathematics. I
had never played a game of tennis in my life
nor even seen a game of basketball, but I was
naturally athletic from the free country life I
had led, and it was soon realized in athletic circles
that I would be on the team with a little
coaching.</p>

<p>I was glad to see that Miss Cox was to teach
me Arithmetic. Miss Peyton hoped I could get
into Algebra by Christmas and then, with hard
study and earnest coaching, perhaps catch up
with the class. I had a feeling that Miss Cox
and I were going to pull together if she could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
just let herself go. Her manner in the class was
rather wooden, but she was an excellent teacher
and the girls were quick to recognize that, so
while she was not popular, she was not disliked.</p>

<p>I was such a stupid in Mathematics that I
was afraid she might put me down as a dunce
and lose all interest in me, but the fact that I
read "Alice in Wonderland" seemed to be in my
favor.</p>

<p>"Page, I will not have you look upon yourself
as hopeless in Arithmetic," she said to me one
day when I despaired of ever understanding
what seemed to me a very intricate problem.
"Lewis Carroll was a great mathematician and
still he wrote the delicious classic that you and
I are so fond of. Now I think minds that appreciate
the same things must be similar. I believe
there is a corner of your brain that is
absolutely unexplored and that corner corresponds
to the great fertile area in Lewis Carroll's.
All it needs in you is working, digging,
cultivating to produce fruit."</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Cox, how splendid of you to look
at it that way! I am going to try awfully hard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
to work my poor, little, neglected, unused plot of
brain with all my might. If I can't grow anything
but green persimmons, that would be better
than nothing."</p>

<p>"Ambition, Distraction, Uglification and Derision
are the hard things. If you look at it
right, one side of Mathematics is really romantic."</p>

<p>Father always said the way to control me
was through my imagination and Miss Cox had
surely hit on my weakness. The result was that
Mathematics was no longer dry-as-dust to me. I
found it had been a closed book because I had
never been interested enough to open it. I soon
outstripped the kids in my class and was put in
a higher one. I had to read frequent chapters
of "Alice in Wonderland" to cheer me on, and
Miss Cox used to quote Lewis Carroll to me
when she and I were alone. I found the other
girls in the classes looked upon her as nothing
but a teacher and she regarded them as mere
pupils, to be taught conscientiously and then dismissed.</p>

<p>One day I sailed safely through a problem<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
that was noted as a regular stumper. As soon
as the class was dismissed, Miss Cox exclaimed:</p>

<p>"'Come to my arms, my beamish boy. You've
slain the Jabberwock.' Page, I really believe you
are going to end by being a pretty good mathematician."</p>

<p>I answered:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'He thought he saw a Garden Door<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">That opened with a key:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">He looked again, and found it was</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">A Double Rule of Three:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">'And all its mystery,' he said,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">'Is clear as day to me!'</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>If I ever understand it, it will be thanks to you
and Lewis Carroll!"</div>

<p>The Tuckers had been to school pretty steadily
all their lives, so they were able to go into
the sophomore class in everything. I bitterly
regretted that my education had been so erratic,
but determined to make the best of it. Dum
helped me with my French and we tried to keep
to our rule of talking French at the table; but
as we did what Mammy Susan called our own
"retching" and my vocabulary was somewhat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
limited, we had to resort to English a great deal
or go unfed.</p>

<p>I know Dum and Dee felt sorry for me for
being in a kids' class in Mathematics. I didn't
really mind nearly so much as they thought I did.
The kids were nice to me and I made some
mighty good friends among them.</p>

<p>There was one little bunchy girl named Mary
Flannigan who turned out in the end one of the
best friends I ever had in my life. She was
short and stumpy, with scrambled red hair and
a freckled face and the very keenest sense of
humor I had ever known. She was a year
younger than I was but very well up in her
classes, and she had a genius for mimicry that
was irresistibly funny. She had some stunts
that endeared her to all the girls. She could
do a dog fight or cats on the back fence; and
could go so like a mosquito that you were certain
you would be bitten in a moment. She was
something of a ventriloquist, which made these
accomplishments especially delightful.</p>

<p>Mary and I were put into Algebra at the same
time, and to our joy Miss Cox was to teach us.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Mary had found out Miss Cox, too. Tweedles
and I had religiously refrained from telling any
of the girls about her mad revel on the day of
our arrival, but we had tried to make them understand
what a very good old girl she was if
you could just find her out; and our attitude
toward her was having its effect on the whole
school. Miss Cox, realizing that she was really
liked and understood, had a change of expression
as well as heart. Her sad, crooked face was
now a happy, crooked face and she no longer
saved her jokes for Tweedles and me, but got
them off indiscriminately, and very good jokes
they were, too. The classes in voice culture became
more popular, and more and more girls
wrote home begging to be allowed to "take singing."</p>

<p>I shall never forget Mary's and my first lesson
in Algebra. Miss Cox looked at us with her
twisted smile.</p>

<p>"Algebra is rather a poetical-sounding name,
don't you think?" she asked us.</p>

<p>"Maybe it is," said Mary, "but I bet it takes it
out in sounding so."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know about that," and Miss Cox
opened the book at the first page and read as
follows: "'In Algebra, the operations of Arithmetic
are abridged and generalized by means of
Symbols.' That appeals to the imagination somewhat,
I think. 'Symbols which represent numbers.'
Just that word 'Symbol' sets me to dreaming.
Arithmetic is the prose of Mathematics
where everything is stated and nothing left to
the imagination, but Algebra is very different.
'Known Numbers are usually represented by the
first letters of the alphabet, as a, b, c. Unknown
Numbers, or those whose values are to be determined,
are usually represented by the last letters
of the alphabet, as x, y, z.' The unknown
numbers,&mdash;the mysterious numbers,&mdash;for what
is unknown is in a measure mysterious and what
is mysterious is romantic or poetic. That is the
way I think of it. In working your Algebra,
don't just look at it as hard, dry facts to be mastered,
but let x, y, z be the Great Unknown
that you are to find. Let the problem be a plot
that you are to unravel as Poe did 'The Gold
Bug.'"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>You may well imagine that Mary and I set to
with a will to get all we could out of such a
thrilling subject. There were times when we
felt that Miss Cox was drawing a little on her
imagination to find poetry in such an example
as this, for instance:</p>

<div class='center'>
4x<sup>-2/3</sup>-3x<sup>-1/3</sup>-27=0<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>On the whole, though, Algebra was much more
interesting than Arithmetic, and sometimes I had
the realization that it did mean a lot to me; and
Mary said she felt the same way. Anyhow, in
the early spring we were able to take the sophomore
tests and go on in that class. Miss Peyton
said she considered it really wonderful that I
should have progressed so rapidly, but I told her
it was all due to Miss Cox's being so certain that
Lewis Carroll and I had similar brains.</div>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FOOTBALL.</div>


<p>None of our crowd had reached what the
grown-ups call "the boy age." We had our
heroes of romance that it was difficult for any
of the male persuasion in real life to live up to.
Tweedles declared that Zebedee was boy enough
for them; although Dum thought if she ever
met a Prosper le Gai she might consider him;
while Dee had an idea a boy like Laurie, in "Little
Women," would be some sport and she might
be willing to knock around with him a bit. Jane
Eyre's "Mr. Rochester" was my beau ideal.</p>

<p>"I want a dark, masterful lover who could
tie the poker up in a bowknot if he had a mind
to; a rude man who could bring tears to my eyes
by his gruffness, and then, with the gentleness
of a woman, soothe my aching head."</p>

<p>"Oh, Page," chimed in Annie Pore, "how
could you want such a ruffian? I like Henry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Esmond, so kind and courteous and dignified&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, and as stiff as a poker. My 'Mr.
Rochester' could tie him up in a bowknot in no
time&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And soothe your aching head with him, too,
I fancy. I think a man who is rude enough to
make a woman cry and strong enough to tie
up pokers would be more than likely to beat his
wife with said poker." This from Mary Flannigan,
who was in our room during the discussion
of our favorite heroes. "I want 'Charles
O'Malley' or nothing. Give me a man who is
gay and rollicking, at the same time good-tempered
and kindly if quick to fight withal."</p>

<p>We had to laugh at Mary. She was such a
little Mother Bunch, with her crinkly red hair
bushing out around her fat freckled face,&mdash;hardly
a likely person to attract a hero of romance.
Mary wore as many petticoats as Mammy
Susan and all of them were tied around her
waist with draw strings. I verily believe that
she and Mammy Susan were the only persons
left in the world who wore red flannel petticoats.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
In that day and generation when slimiky
skirts were the rage, you can fancy how Mary
looked with her gathered skirts. She also had
a leaning toward deep ruffles around her neck,
which more than ever gave her the look of a
clown dog.</p>

<p>She had a way of breaking into the conversation
very much as the clown dog breaks into
the ring, and no matter how serious she was, we
simply had to laugh at her. She was very good-natured
and not the least bit touchy. We
laughed at her general bunchiness just because
we couldn't help it, but one and all liked her for
her good temper and ready wit and respected her
for her excellent standing in her classes, where
she was the youngest pupil. We also envied her
the delightful stunts that I believe I have mentioned
before.</p>

<p>"I'd rather be able to go like a dog, the way
Mary can, than make the finest statue of one
that ever was done," sighed Dum.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Dum. Anybody can go like a
dog with a little practice, but to make one in clay
is going some. But to return to our lovers:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
what do you girls say to taking in the football
game over at Hill-Top? The seniors are going,
one and all, and Miss Peyton says any of us can
go who wish. Miss Cox will chaperon the
sophomores."</p>

<p>Hill-Top was a boys' school on the other side
of the village from Gresham Academy, and
young ladies from our school were always invited
to the match games there; and our school
in turn sent a formal invitation to the pupils of
Hill-Top when an interesting basketball game
was to be played at Gresham.</p>

<p>"Oh, do come, all of you. I've never seen a
game of football in my life and I'm just wild
to," I begged.</p>

<p>"I guess I won't go," said Annie.</p>

<p>"Well, I think you've got another guess coming,
unless you have a powerful good reason,"
I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"My only reason is that I am so embarrassed
with boys," and poor Annie gave her usual painful
blush.</p>

<p>"Oh, you won't have to speak to the boys.
They never notice the Sophs, anyhow, but give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
all their twaddle to the Juniors and Seniors. If
a boy, old enough to walk 'loney, breaks through
Mabel Binks' guard, he is a hero for fair,"
laughed Dee.</p>

<p>So, Annie's objections overcome, we hurried
her and Mary off to put on their hats and wraps,
and quickly donning our own, got downstairs
just in time to form in line with the Sophomores,
who were starting under the leadership of Miss
Cox for the game at Hill-Top.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to see you are going, Page," said
Margaret Sayre, as she hooked her arm in mine.
"I am to help Miss Cox keep order, although I
don't really think I am needed. Sophomores
are never boy crazy. The Juniors are the ones,
as a rule, that need quieting. Sometimes I wonder
where all the bad Juniors go to and where
all the good Seniors come from."</p>

<p>"Well, I reckon the bad Juniors were once
good Sophomores and they can just as easily
turn into good Seniors," I responded.</p>

<p>The Juniors at Gresham were a rather wild
lot and they had as a leader Mabel Binks, who,
although she was a Senior, chose her friends entirely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
among the Juniors. The truth of the matter
was, as Mammy Susan used to say, Mabel
would rather be a "king among buzzards than
a buzzard among kings." The Seniors would
have none of her leadership and among them
she had to take a back seat; while the Juniors
welcomed her to their ranks with joy, not realizing
why she had chosen them, and flattered
by her notice.</p>

<p>The long line of girls, two abreast, wound its
way through the streets of the little town and
out into the country again to the boys' school.
It was really a very pretty sight, this row of
blooming, happy girls, all ages and sizes, dressed
in the universally becoming dark blue, with their
jaunty velvet sailor hats perched at every conceivable
angle on heads of hair of every conceivable
color.</p>

<p>"Doesn't Annie Pore look pretty in her new
hat?" whispered Miss Sayre.</p>

<p>These velvet sailors were ordered by the school
and every pupil was obliged to have one. All
of us were glad that Annie was forced to discard
her forlorn-looking cr&ecirc;pe hat that looked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
for all the world like a last year's bird's nest.
The black velvet sailor was exactly right for
her, throwing into pleasing contrast her milk-white
skin, and bringing out the wonderful tints
in her ripe-wheat hair. Jo Barr with wonderful
tact had managed to change the hang of
her dragging skirt and it was now even around
the bottom.</p>

<p>"I think she is beautiful and she is really very
fine in many ways. I have grown so fond of
her. All of us have. And I think Dum and
Dee are having a splendid effect on her spirits,
for she is not nearly so lugubrious."</p>

<p>"Dum and Dee may be having a fine effect,
too," laughed Miss Sayre, "but a girl named
Page Allison is doing her part. All the faculty
notice it. I wish someone like you could be in
every class, someone to leaven the whole lump
with a certain quality of camaraderie. Annie
Pore was as forlorn a specimen of humanity as
ever stepped out of a 'bus that first day here,
and now look at her!"</p>

<p>Annie was laughing heartily as Mary Flannigan
made a noise like a sick kitten, throwing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
her voice, with her powers as a ventriloquist,
so it seemed to come from a clump of sumac by
the roadside. Dee was peering eagerly into the
bushes before she caught on to the joke. Annie
Pore certainly did not look like the same girl.
No one would think of nicknaming her "Orphan
Annie" now. The name clung to her, however,
among a certain class, thanks to Mabel Binks,
who had not been able to forgive or forget the
laugh raised against her by Annie on the first
day of school.</p>

<p>Hill-Top was built much in the same style as
Gresham, and it, too, had the Parthenon effect
with its big white pillars. The view was not
quite so fine as ours, but from the little experience
I had had of boys, I imagined they did not
go in for views to any great extent.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"A primrose by the river's brink,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">A common primrose was to him and nothing more."</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>For that matter, I noticed that mighty few of
the girls at Gresham appreciated the view, and
as Miss Sayre said, thought more of dessert for
dinner than of the view of the mountains.</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>The game was just starting as we arrived, so
we seated ourselves on the benches provided for
the visitors with as little stir as possible. Dum
got on the other side of me to put me on to the
points of the great game of football.</p>

<p>"It seems too foolish and backwoodsy for me
never to have seen a game," I said, "but at Milton
everyone is too old to do more than walk
through a set of croquet or too young to do
more than bounce a rubber ball. Father occasionally
threatens to go up to Richmond for the
Virginia-Carolina game at Thanksgiving, but
somebody is always coming or going (I mean
getting born or dying), and we have never made
it yet."</p>

<p>"Never mind, honey," and Dum gave me a
hug, "you'll learn all the points of the game to-day,
and some time when we are back in Richmond,
Zebedee will give us a great football party.
We always go to the Thanksgiving game. I
don't see what Zebedee will do without us this
year."</p>

<p>"Who, that good-looking pa of yours?" said
Mabel Binks, who was seated right in front of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
us, with the Juniors, as usual. "Why, I'll wager
he can find someone to take your place. I bet
he's having a pretty good time with you kids
off his hands."</p>

<p>Dum's hands clinched and unclinched. Her
eyes were closed and her lips moving. I had
not lived with the Tucker Twins for several
weeks without finding out what that meant.
When Dum did that way, it meant she was trying
to control her temper. Her lips formed these
words: "Oh, God, make me good! Don't let me
biff Mabel Binks! Don't let me biff Mabel
Binks!"</p>

<p>For a moment the wicked wish came into my
heart that she would "biff Mabel Binks"; but
when I thought of the consternation it would
arouse in Gresham and the disgrace to our class,
to say nothing of poor hot-headed Dum, I felt
ashamed of myself for harboring such a militant
desire. I slipped my hand over Dum's
clenched fist and in a moment I felt it relax.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Page. God answered my prayer
quicker than usual, thanks to you," and Dum
gave a great sigh of relief. "It seemed to me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
almost like it would be wrong if I didn't hit her.
Zebedee would fight for us any day and I don't
see why I can't fight for him."</p>

<p>"Well, when you come down to facts, Dum,
Mabel Binks did not say anything derogatory
of your father. She said he was good-looking
and intimated that he was naturally popular. I
fancy she would like to go to the Thanksgiving
game herself with him. There is nothing for
you to fight about. I have an idea that Mr.
Tucker can take care of himself enough not to
take her to the game at least," I whispered; and
Dum laughed aloud so that Mabel turned
around and asked, "What's the joke?" And
Dum had the satisfaction of saying in honeyed
tones: "One of the kid jokes that I fancy you
would not appreciate."</p>

<p>The game of football at first impressed me
as little more than a tangle of legs, and a dog
fight at Bracken had more sense to it; but as
Dum explained the points, I began to see some
method in the seeming madness of twenty-two
boys lying down on one poor ball and yelling.
Needless to add, I very soon became as enthusiastic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
about that game as all other games I ever
had any knowledge of, and before the football
season was over I was as rabid a rooter as the
Tuckers themselves.</p>

<p>"I believe you are a born lover of games,
Page," said Miss Sayre, smiling as my enthusiasm
got the better of me and I let out a piercing
shriek in honor of a short, bow-legged boy who
had seized the ball at a crucial moment and literally
dodged his way through the Seniors and
made a goal. The game was between the Seniors
and Sophomores, and of course the Sophomores
of Gresham were in honor bound to root
for the Sophomores of Hill-Top.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Who's all right? Who's all right?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Shorty!&mdash;Shorty! Out of sight!"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>yelled the class for their bow-legged hero, and
then the Seniors gave him fifteen 'rahs. Seniors
always have a special feeling for Sophomores
and a game between them is usually a
very friendly bout. Of course the Seniors do
not exactly want to be beaten, but they take
a great delight in the prowess of their pet class.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
In spite of Shorty's good playing and a great
deal of good playing from the other ten Sophomores,
the Seniors won, which was quite meet
and proper. The younger boys had put up a
good fight and were much applauded by their
elders.</div>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BOYS.</div>


<p>After the football game, some of the more
self-assured boys came over to the visitors from
Gresham and singled out their friends to conduct
them to the tables on the lawn where the
matron was serving ice cream.</p>

<p>All the boys spoke to Miss Cox and seemed
on the most friendly terms with her. I remembered
then that she went over to Hill-Top twice
a week for the purpose of training a chorus.
She knew them all by name and chatted with
them very freely, much more freely than she
did with any of the girls, except Dum and Dee
and me.</p>

<p>"Evidently, Miss Cox understands boys better
than she does girls and they understand her,"
thought I. Her manner with them was frank
and natural, exactly as it had been with Mr.
Tucker.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>A tall, good-looking boy was holding a laughing
conversation with her about the game. He
it was who had saved the day for the Seniors
when it had looked as though the younger class
would certainly win, owing to the strategic
movements of the popular Shorty.</p>

<p>"Didn't the kid make a fine play, though, Miss
Cox? It seemed a pity to take the game from
them; but I tell you, if the Sophomores won
from the Seniors there would be no living with
them. They're rather a cocky lot as it is, bless
'em."</p>

<p>"Yes, they are fine boys and I wish they might
have won just this once. They worked so hard
and you Seniors were playing so lazily you almost
let the game slip through your fingers. It
would have been a good lesson for your team if
they had lost."</p>

<p>"That's just what I tell them, Miss Cox. I
hate lazy playing, even if you are up against
something easy. I believe in playing the game
to the best of your ability, if it's nothing but
push-pins."</p>

<p>I certainly liked the way that boy talked and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
agreed with him. I unconsciously drew nearer
to where he and Miss Cox were standing, not
with any idea of being introduced but because I
was interested in what they were saying.</p>

<p>"No, you don't, Miss Buttinsky," was whispered
in my ear, "Seniors first when there is a
good thing in sight," and Mabel Binks crowded
in front of me and deliberately joined the group
around Miss Cox. An introduction to the handsome
football player naturally followed. I drew
back abashed. One of the most hateful things
about Mabel Binks was that she usually attributed
her motives to other persons. She was
determined to meet this boy and she took for
granted it was what I was after, too.</p>

<p>I felt like employing Dum's method and praying
not to "biff Mabel Binks," but I was anxious
to see what the outcome would be and if the
handsome youth, whose name I had learned was
Harvie Price, would be attracted by the charms
of the stylish Mabel. Mabel was not a bad-looking
girl, rather handsome, in fact, but a
trifle too vivid for my taste. Her eyes were as
black and shiny as new patent-leather shoes; her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
abundant hair, coarse and curly; her lips too full
and red; her figure handsome but rather too well
developed for a girl of seventeen. She was always
richly dressed and in the latest style.</p>

<p>The idea of the directors of Gresham in having
the pupils dress in blue suits and black hats
was to do away with the custom of overdressing
common to many boarding schools. They seemed
to think that a blue suit was a blue suit. They
were vastly mistaken, however, as anyone with
half an eye could see by comparing Mabel Binks
with Annie Pore. Annie Pore's appearance I
have described. Mabel's suit was a costly affair
of handsome cloth combined with velvet and
trimmed with fur. The skirt was slit, showing
a cerise petticoat; a cerise cr&ecirc;pe de Chine tie gave
color to her very V-necked blouse; and around
her velvet sailor she had pinned several large,
fine ostrich plumes. The latest style of high-heeled
pumps with cut steel buckles were on her
feet, making them a little too prominent, considering
their size and shape. Spotless white
gloves finished her costume; unless one might
consider the strong odor of musk perfume the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
finishing touch. She did look handsome and her
clothes were pretty and fine, but a little too fine
for a football match.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Price," she gushed, "your playing
was just grand. All of us were just wild about
it. I said 'it,' not 'you,' you understand," and
she giggled affectedly. "I think it was real noble
of you to let the kids get any points at all."</p>

<p>"Yes, mighty noble," said Harvie Price, looking
at his dashing admirer rather quizzically, "so
noble they came mighty near winning the whole
shooting match."</p>

<p>"Isn't that ice cream they are serving over
there?" she hinted. "I think ice cream is simply
grand."</p>

<p>"Ah, Miss Binks, you praise my feeble game
and ice cream with the same words. Fortunately,
ice cream is more easily taken in than
I am. Hey, you Shorty, come here," he called
to the jolly-looking little Sophomore who was
trotting by. "I want to introduce you to Miss
Binks. Mr. Thomas Hawkins, Miss Binks.
Shorty, she's dying for some ice cream."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your humble servitor, madam," and Thomas
Hawkins made a low bow. "Shall I bring it to
you or take you to it?"</p>

<p>"Bring it here," said Mabel shortly. Just then
Harvie Price saw Annie Pore talking to Mary
Flannigan and Dee.</p>

<p>"Tell me who that girl is over there, the one
with the thick yellow plait," he asked Mabel.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's 'Orphan Annie.' Isn't she a
mess?"</p>

<p>"Is her name Annie Pore?"</p>

<p>"I believe it is or poor Annie, if you prefer."</p>

<p>"Well, by Jove! Who would have thought it!"
and Harvie Price without any apology left the
dashing Mabel and going up to Annie took her
by both hands. He shook them warmly and exclaimed:
"Little Annie Pore, where on earth
did you come from? I am glad to see you." And
Annie, without the least embarrassment, was
equally delighted to see him.</p>

<p>"Oh, Harvie, I did not dream you were here.
You've grown so I didn't know you."</p>

<p>"Grown! And what have you been doing?
Certainly not standing still. And how is everyone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
at the Landing? Geewhilikins, I'd like to
spend another summer there! Just think, it is
five years since I have been there."</p>

<p>"Everything is about the same. Your grandfather
is rather more feeble but as handsome as
ever."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, poor old Grandad," said Harvie
soberly. Annie told me afterward that a family
row had separated old General Price from his
son, Harvie's father, and for that reason the boy
had not been allowed to come to his ancestral
home at Price's Landing.</p>

<p>"And how is your father? As British as ever
and still invisibly clothed in blue paint?"</p>

<p>"Yes, about the same," blushed Annie.</p>

<p>"You know I like your father, Annie, and
didn't mean anything," and the boy looked very
sorry that he had embarrassed his little friend.</p>

<p>"That's all right, Harvie, but you know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," he said sympathetically. "Now
come on and let's have some ice cream. Who are
your special friends? Introduce me and I'll take
them all."</p>

<p>Dum and Dee and Mary Flannigan and I were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
of course the chosen few, and as soon as Shorty
had arranged so Mabel Binks could "take in" the
ice cream, he joined us and a very merry time
we had. We met many boys and liked most of
them. They were a healthy, wholesome lot and
almost as much fun as girls. Miss Cox joined
us and let herself go with as much abandon as
she had in the Lobster Quadrille.</p>

<p>I have never seen anyone so happy as Annie
Pore. She and Harvie Price had been friends
from the time they could walk. The boy had
spent a great deal of his time with his grandfather
at Price's Landing and the little English
maid, whose father kept the country store, was
the one white child in the neighborhood whom
the proud old aristocratic General Price considered
suitable to associate with his grandson.</p>

<p>"You ought to see Mr. Pore," Harvie confided
to me. "I tell you he is a rare one. He is about
the best educated man I ever met. Grandad
says he can think in Latin. Be that as it may,
he can certainly teach it. I had some lessons
from him during one summer and have been
grateful to him ever since. He is awfully English<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
and just as strict with Annie as can be. Mrs.
Pore was a beautiful woman and it seemed
strangely incongruous to see her in the country
store measuring calico and what not. Grandad
used to say she looked like a Duchess at a Charity
Bazaar. Nobody at Price's Landing ever has
known what brought Mr. Pore to keeping a
country store in a little Virginia village."</p>

<p>"Maybe thinking in Latin wasn't nourishing,"
I suggested.</p>

<p>"I fancy that was it," he laughed, "but why
should an Oxford graduate keep a country store
for a livelihood? There must have been other
avenues open to him."</p>

<p>"Perhaps his beautiful wife discovered she
had a genius for selling at Charity Bazaars, and
when the time came to choose a profession, she
chose what she had shown talent for as an amateur,"
I hazarded.</p>

<p>"Well, I see Miss Page Allison has some imagination
and if she ever has to choose a profession
it should be novel writing."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it will be," I said, "but I'd rather
keep a country store than do anything. You can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
see so many people that way, 'specially if you
have the postoffice in it."</p>

<p>"You like people, then?" inquired the boy.</p>

<p>"Like people? I should say I do. I just adore
people; and I mean to know just as many people
as I can."</p>

<p>"Well, that is the requisite for successful novel
writing, so our professor in English tells us:
'Know people and sympathize with them, all
kinds and conditions.' But tell me something,
Miss Page, does Annie sing? Mrs. Pore's voice
brought old sinners to church that had not been
for many a year. She sang in the choir at the
little old Episcopal church at Price's Landing
and although I was nothing but a kid,&mdash;you see
I have not been there for five years,&mdash;I used to
thrill all over when she chanted the <i>Te Deum
Laudamus</i>."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Annie's voice is splendid. Miss Cox
is teaching her and I believe she expects great
things of her. We are to have a concert at Gresham
before long and then you can hear her."</p>

<p>I looked over at a group of girls and boys
where Dum and Annie were talking very gayly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
with Tom Hawkins, alias Shorty, and smiled to
think of Annie's hesitancy in coming that day
because she was so afraid of boys, and then I
laughed outright when I considered how little
Shorty resembled Dum's hero, Prosper le Gai.</p>

<p>The ice cream that Shorty brought to Mabel
Binks must have been as bitter as gall, judging
from the faces that young lady made while devouring
it, nor did it "set easy on her innards,"
as Mammy Susan would put it. Could it be
that she had literally turned green from jealousy
and the ice cream was innocent, after all?
It must have been a bitter pill to have the despised
"Orphan Annie," with her kid friends,
carry off the most desirable young man at Hill-Top.</p>

<p>"Aren't you feeling well, Mabel?" said the
good-natured Josephine Barr, as Harvie Price
and I passed near her on our way to join the
group where my special friends were.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm just disgusted. Did you ever see
such a beau grabber in your life as that countrified
Page Allison? And there's 'Orphan Annie'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
actually posing as a belle! They make me
sick."</p>

<p>I did not hear what Jo answered, but I felt
that Annie and I were safe in her hands. My
cheeks were burning as though Mabel had given
me a real slap.</p>

<p>"Don't you mind, Miss Page. If girls only
knew how fellows detest that kind of thing! It
must be awful to be a girl and not fight things
out. If a boy had insulted me as that girl did
you just now, I'd either beat him or get beaten
in short order."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, pulling myself together as I
realized that after all Mabel Binks was not much
of a lady, "you see, I have already beaten her,
although I did not know at the time I was doing
it. Annie and I have got the 'beaux,' that is, if
she means you and Shorty."</p>

<p>"Bully for you! That's the way to talk. I
see Miss Binks will not pull off anything over
you. Can Annie defend herself, too?"</p>

<p>So I told him of the first day at Gresham and
the cheer the Seniors gave Annie because of her
come-back at Mabel Binks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor little Annie! I don't see how anyone
could try to hurt her," and the big boy looked
very tenderly at his one-time playmate. "I am
certainly glad she has found such good friends
at Gresham as you and those wonderful twins,
and also that nice little square Irish girl who
looks like a match for our Shorty."</p>

<p>That night before lights out bell rang, we had
a little chat in our room. Mary and Annie had
scurried across the hall in their kimonos. Dum
was in bed and Dee and I had unearthed some
slight refreshment in the way of crackers and
sweet chocolate, which we passed around.</p>

<p>"I bet Prosper le Gai would have played a
dandy game of football," said Dum, getting her
sheets all crumby with crackers. "He always
smiled in battle. I noticed Harvie Price did,
too."</p>

<p>"Do you know, I think Harvie Price looked a
little like Laurie in 'Little Women,'" said Dee.</p>

<p>"I always did think so," exclaimed Annie.
"When you were talking about Laurie this morning
I thought of Harvie. I never dreamed of
seeing him. I'm so glad you girls liked him."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>"I tell you he's all right," said Mary, "but
I wouldn't be at all astonished if Charles O'Malley
wasn't just such another boy as Shorty when
he was a kid."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>LETTERS AND SEVERAL KINDS OF FATHERS.</div>


<div class='center'>From Page Allison to Miss Sue Lee, Washington, D. C.</div>

<div class="blockquot">My dearest Cousin Sue:

<p>You told me not to write to you until I had
got real settled and could give you some decided
opinions about the place and the people. I am
settled now and feel as though I had been born
and bred here. I just love it and am making
loads and loads of friends.</p>

<p>First thing I must tell you how right my
clothes are. It is splendid not to have to think
about them, but just to put them on and know
that they are suitable. Some of the girls here
are great dressers, in spite of the endeavors of
the directors to put them into a kind of uniform,
but I can't see that their fine clothes make them
any more popular than the others. Do you
know, Cousin Sue, I'd rather be popular than
be president?</p>

<p>My roommates, the Tucker twins, are awfully
popular, but they don't care nearly so much about
it as I do. You see, they have been knowing
lots of people all their lives and I haven't. Sometimes
I am afraid I'll get kind of mealy-mouthed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
in my anxiety to have people like me, and the
only thing that saves me from it is my hatred
of fools and snobs. I know I shouldn't hate
fools because they can't help it, but I think snobs
ought to be hated.</p>

<p>We have become acquainted with some boys
from Hill-Top, the academy on the other side
of the town. They are real nice and I find I
am not at all embarrassed with them. They are
not a bit beauy or lovery (the Tuckers and I
would hate that), but they are just boys and
have got lots more sense than I expected to find
in the male sex.</p>

<p>The Juniors here at Gresham are lots of them
beau crazy. They talk about boys from morning
till night. I do hope when I get to be a Junior
I won't go through that stage. Miss Sayre, a
lovely girl and too nice to me for anything, a
pupil teacher and at least nineteen, says she has
never known but one girl in her life who arrived
at her age without going through the stage of
talking about boys all the time, and she says that
poor girl was dumb and she took it out in making
eyes. Dum and Dee and I told her we'd
cut out our tongues before we'd make boys our
sole topic of conversation, and Miss Sayre just
laughed and asked us if we would gouge out our
eyes, too.</p>

<p>I am doing very well in my studies, and working
awfully hard. You see, we have to spend
a certain time over our books and learn in spite
of ourselves. French is coming easy to me and
I believe it is because Father has drilled me so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
thoroughly in Latin. I am getting on top of
Mathematics by the hardest kind of climbing.
At first I felt as though I'd have to remove
mountains ever to learn a thing, but now I realize
I don't have to remove mountains, but just
climb them; and certainly as you climb you get
an outlook that you never dreamed of.</p>

<p>Father writes very cheerfully but I am afraid
he is mighty lonesome. I feel very selfish to be
off here having such a good time when I know
how hard it is for him. I wish you would write
him a nice long letter. Your letters always do
him good.</p>

<p>I like Miss Peyton, our principal, ever and
ever so much; she is so just. All of the teachers
are pretty nice, but I am not getting quite
as much from the English Literature teacher as
I hoped I would. She is a good teacher, I have
no doubt, but not interesting. I have the feeling
that she likes what the textbooks tell her to, and
has no taste of her own. Her knowledge of
poetry, for instance, stops with the age of Tennyson.</p>

<p>You know Father's extravagance and relaxation
is poetry, past, present and even future. He
has been reading poetry to me since before I
could talk, and a new poet is more interesting
to him than a new disease. He had never told
me that poetry had to arrive at a certain age,
like veal or cheese, before it was worthy to be
taken in; and I brought down the scorn and
wrath of Miss Prince on my devoted head and
came mighty near getting enough demerits to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
keep me in bounds a week, because I asked her
if she did not think Masefield's poem of "The
Dauber" had more atmosphere of the deep sea
in it than "The Ancient Mariner." She looked
at me very severely through her visible bi-focals
and said: "Miss Allison, this is a class in English
Literature; and matters foreign to the subject
are not to be discussed."</p>

<p>I rather miss the reading I have always done.
We study so hard there is no time to read, and
the library is one of these donated ones. It
has sets of Dickens and Scott in such fine print
that you can't keep your place, a few odd volumes
of Thackeray, Milton and Pope, and the
rest of the shelves are crowded with books that
some generous patron evidently has had no use
for himself. They are the kind of books that
Father says are good enough to keep the doors
open with or to put under a rocker when you
don't want to rock.</p>

<p>There is a good encyclopedia and dictionary
and our textbooks are very complete. I believe
it is good for me to have to confine myself to
the textbooks for a while, but I shall be glad
to be at Bracken again and curl up on the sofa
with the dogs some dull old rainy day and read
as long as I can see.</p>

<p>Some day I hope you will know my friends. I
have told them all about you and they think you
are splendid. The Tucker twins are going to
stay a few days at Bracken during the holidays,
and I am to be with them for a week-end in
Richmond. It will be a more agreeable visit than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the time I spent with Cousin Park Garnett, I
fancy. By the way, Cousin Park sent me a present
the other day. You could never guess what
it is: a black and purple crocheted shoulder
shawl! I'm real glad to have it because we are
going to have a dicker party and it will be the
very thing to contribute.</p>

<p>You don't know how much obliged I am to you
for the huge box of marshmallows. We have
not opened it yet, as we are saving up for a
grand spread that Dum and Dee and I are going
to give. Good-by, dear Cousin Sue.</p>

My dearest Tweedles:

<p>How am I ever to get through Thanksgiving
without you? Of course I'm going to the game
to root for Virginia, but I'll be mighty lonesome.
I've been invited to join several parties,
but I believe I'll take old Brindle and go by my
lonely. The only pleasure I take in Thanksgiving
is that it is just a little nearer to Christmas,
when I'll have my babies back with me for
a delirious three weeks.</p>

<p>I miss you so much that I can't remember
what my reason was for thinking it best for you
to go to boarding school. I must have had some
good reason, but it is swallowed up in misery<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
over your absence. Could it have been that you
needed training and to learn to control yourselves?
Foolish notion! When you come home
you can fight all over the shop if you've a mind;
and sass your pa until he crawls under the bed
with Brindle; and get late to your meals; and
go around with holes in your stockings; do anything,
in fact, that your fancy dictates. All I
ask of you is to come home the same old Tweedles,
loving your poor, lonesome, old Zebedee as
much as ever.</p>

<p>I am delighted that you are making so many
good friends. There is nothing in all the world
like friends and the ones made in early years
are worth all the others put together.</p>

<p>Please remember me to Miss Page Allison and
tell her I saw her father the other day, and
he was looking mighty fit, considering he has
not had her to take care of him for so long. He
had come up to Richmond for a medical convention.
I am glad you are enjoying Miss Page so
much. I liked her on short acquaintance better
than any friend you have ever had. I am delighted
that you have invited her to spend some
of the holidays with us. I asked Dr. Allison
if he could spare her to us for a few days, and
he said of course he could. You girls seem to
have a mutual admiration society. Miss Page,
according to Dr. Allison, is as enthusiastic about
my girls as my girls are about his girl.</p>

<p>I am intensely gratified that the three of you
have kept up with the poor scared child we met
on the train. Such a wholesome trio would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
sure to be good for the timid, miserable little
thing. You must ask her to come to see us in
Richmond if you have not already done so.</p>

<p>I am sending you a box of goodies for your
day-after-Thanksgiving spread. I am afraid
some of the things are contraband, but people
who make rules would not make them unless
they expected schoolgirls and their outrageous
young fathers to break them. I fancy I have
concealed the true nature of the contents of the
box, and unless the supervision is very thorough,
it will pass muster and the contraband articles
find the way to their destination&mdash;your little
insides. Love to Jinny Cox.</p>

My dear little daughter:

<p>I saw young Jeffry Tucker in Richmond last
week and what he had to tell me of my girl
gratified me greatly. I am not going to divulge
to you what he said, but you may know it was
something pretty nice.</p>

<p>I miss you very much, my dear Page, but poor
old Mammy Susan is worse off than I am because
she is at home all the time and I am off
on my rounds, and when I am at home, thank
God, I have books. I do not mean to say that
books take the place of my girl, but I mean I
can bury myself in them and for the time being
be oblivious to everything else.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>Sally Winn is still trying to die, poor woman.
I was called out in the wee small hours this
morning to help her cross the Styx. She has
been more determined than ever since Mrs.
Purdy passed over. She is very jealous and
said this morning: "Betty Purdy always was a
pushing thing. She made out all the time she
didn't want to go but that's not so, I know.
She's been getting ahead of me all her life. Pretended
she married Purdy because he was so
bent on it that she had to. Everybody knows it
was just the other way, she was so bent on it,
Purdy had to." Of course you must have heard
that Mr. Purdy courted Sally first. I suggested
that it would be well if she tried to live and perhaps
she might console the widower; and do you
know, I left her with a much stronger pulse.</p>

<p>I hope your Thanksgiving will go off finely.
I cannot tell you how we long for you, my dear;
but Christmas will soon be here, and in the meantime
I am going to bury myself in a new book
I got in Richmond last week.</p>

<p>I am so glad for you to make these good
friends you write of. The Twins sound delightful.
Tucker is one of the best fellows I know.
He is ridiculously young to be the father of
girls as old as you. He is one of the cleverest
newspaper men in the South, so clever I wonder
the South keeps him. New York newspapers
seem to suck in all the bright men sooner or
later.</p>

<p>I am so glad your friends will come to Bracken
for a visit with you during the holidays, and I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
will of course let you go to them for a visit. I
may run up to the city at the same time. Cousin
Park Garnett has made me promise to stay with
her the first time I go to Richmond, so I am
afraid the trip will not be altogether hilarious
for me.</p>

<p>The dogs send love to their mistress in yaps,
yowls and whines. Mammy says she hopes "you
ain't done wash all de meat off'n you in dem

</div>

My dear Annie:

<p>I am most gratified at the account you give
of the progress you are making in your studies.
The authenticity of your account is verified by
the report I have received from the principal of
the institution.</p>

<p>I am surprised and grieved that you should
find your wardrobe not sufficient for your needs.
There is a vulgar tendency among all Americans
to overdress which you must avoid. Remember
that in your veins flows the blood of
Ponsonby and de Vere and that is more to be
considered than all the fine clothes in the world
of the <i>nouveau riche</i>. I will send you the box
containing some old lace and a white dress of
your Mother's. If that is not suitable, I think<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
you had better not appear at the concert of which
you write.</p>

<p>I also wish to warn you against undue intimacies
with persons of whom you know little or
nothing. The sacrifice I am making in sending
you to boarding school is not that you may
amuse yourself with friends no doubt beneath
you in birth and breeding but that you may perfect
yourself in your studies and cultivate your
voice, which may prove of material benefit to
you.</p>

<p>General Price called on me yesterday and told
me he had received a letter from his grandson,
Harvie, in which he had mentioned the fact that
he had met you at a football game. I hope you
are not wasting much of your time in such frivolous
pursuits.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>ANNIE'S MOTHER.</div>


<p>We were rather troubled about Annie Pore
and what on earth she was going to wear to the
concert. Her wardrobe, not being extensive,
was well known to all of her friends and certainly
there was nothing suitable in it for a girl
who was going to have to stand up on the stage
and sing.</p>

<p>"If she would only not be so proud," groaned
Dum; "but who could say to Lady Clara Vere
de Vere, 'Let me lend you some of my duds?'
Now I shouldn't in the least mind borrowing
anything from anybody if I thought the person
cared for me. Don't I wear the Liberty scarf
your Cousin Sue sent you every time I find it
idle, and if I could borrow from you, Page,
why shouldn't Annie?"</p>

<p>"Well, it is different, Dum, because Annie
hasn't got anything. You borrow the scarf just
as a frill, but if it were a necessity I don't believe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
you would." I had intense sympathy for
Annie because I could fancy what my own
clothes would have been if dear Cousin Sue
Lee had not had them in charge. Miss Pinky
Davis, our country dressmaker, would have
turned out just such another crooked seamed
suit as Annie's if Cousin Sue had not insisted on
a mail order, and I know my shirtwaists would
have been big where they should have been little,
and little where they should have been big:
and as for Middy blouses, there is no telling
what they would have looked like: rick-rack
trimming on the collar, no doubt, and ruffles
around the tail. Cousin Sue did let Miss Pinky
make me some white evening dresses and they
turned out all right because Cousin Sue bridled
Miss Pinky's fancy.</p>

<p>"Let me see," said Dee, "as far as I can remember
Annie has a blue serge skirt, two white
shirtwaists, one blue poplin one and a plaid silk
blouse for Sunday. I can't bear to think of her
on the stage in any of that array. Of course
it makes no difference to any of us, but think
of that nasty Mabel Binks and her following!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Ugh! I tell you one thing," she added excitedly,
"if any of them make Annie feel bad, they've
got me to fight."</p>

<p>"Me, too," chimed in Dum.</p>

<p>"Well, I can't see that that would help Annie's
clothes much," I laughed, "but it might
keep you, Tweedles, from having apoplexy."</p>

<p>"Dee, you've got so much tact, you go see Annie
and find out what she is going to wear," suggested
Dum.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, not me! I'm so afraid I might leak,
and that would never do," and Dee got out a
handkerchief ready for emergencies. "You see,
I feel so bad about Annie and so desperately
sorry for her that I have to cry just thinking
about her, and what would it be if she should
get out her poor little blouses and ask my advice?
Just think of all the clothes Jo Barr has,
simply going to waste and how old Jo would
love to dress Annie up in them! Still, we all
know that Annie would be cut to the quick at
the suggestion of such a thing. Oh, dear, oh,
dear! I wonder what Zebedee would do."</p>

<p>"Well, I know what I am going to do," I said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
uncurling myself from the window sill where I
could, by a good deal of craning of the neck,
catch a glimpse of my beloved mountains; "I'm
going in and have it out with Annie. She knows
I love her and I don't believe I'll hurt her feelings.
I think she trusts us, and when you really
trust people they simply can't hurt your feelings
unless you have a natural born chip on
your shoulder, which Annie hasn't."</p>

<p>"Oh, Page, you are just like Zebedee,"
tweedled the twins. "That's what he would
do."</p>

<p>I found Annie looking very like old Rain-in-the-Face.
She was in a forlorn heap on the
floor; her eyes red; her ripe-wheat hair all
disheveled; and in her hand a crumpled letter.
On the floor by her was an unopened box which
had just come by parcels post.</p>

<p>Her "Come in" in answer to my knock had
been more like a sob than an invitation to enter.</p>

<p>"What is it, dear Annie? Tweedles and I
have just been talking about you and we wonder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
if you know how much we love you. Do you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Page, I don't see how you can!"</p>

<p>"Well, we do, and I said I believed you loved
us enough to trust us. I mean to understand
that we could never hurt your feelings in any
possible way, just because we'd rather be boiled
alive than hurt you."</p>

<p>Annie looked up and smiled a rather watery
smile, but a smile all the same.</p>

<p>"Now s'pose you trust me and tell me what
is the matter. What are friends for if you can't
tell them your troubles?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Page, I'd like to tell you, but it would
seem so disloyal to my Father."</p>

<p>"You understand, Annie, that if you tell me
anything it would be just like telling it to a
Father Confessor. I mean I'd never breathe a
word of it." It sounded as though I were full of
curiosity, but while of course I did want to
know, my reason for pressing Annie was that I
felt she needed to let off steam, that is, her pent-up
emotions.</p>

<p>"I know you are the best friend any girl ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
had and I believe I will tell you all about everything."</p>

<p>"Well, wash your face first and let me brush
your hair while you talk."</p>

<p>So Annie got up and bathed her face, and
while I combed and brushed her thick, yellow
hair, she told me the following tale:</p>

<p>"You see, Page, my Father is an Englishman
and he is awfully proud. He does not understand
a little girl a bit nor did he understand
my beautiful Mother. He loved her, though,
adored her, in fact, and I know has never been
happy one minute since she died; that's been
about four years now. He does not love me,
though, I am afraid; but maybe I do him an injustice
and don't understand him. Anyhow, he
is never chummy and chatty with me like Mr.
Tucker is with Tweedles."</p>

<p>"I bet he does love you, Annie. My Father
is not so intimate with me as Mr. Tucker is with
his girls, but I know he loves me. You see, Mr.
Tucker is almost the same age as his daughters
and I fancy your Father is much older than
you are, just as mine is." And I went on brushing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
her hair, knowing she was becoming calmer
and beginning rather to enjoy talking about herself.</p>

<p>"My Father, you know, is very well born; in
fact, his Father was a baronet of very ancient
stock and his elder brother now has the title and
estates. Father was educated for the church.
He has an Oxford degree and is very scholarly.
However, after all his education, he did not want
to take orders. He felt that he had no vocation
for the ministry, and he and my grandfather
had an awful row about it. You see, English
younger sons have to do something. Mother
told me all this. Father has never mentioned
it to me. He occasionally reminds me that I
am of good birth and that is his only reference
to England. Immediately after this row with
Grandfather, he met Mother and fell in love with
her at first sight. It was at a Charity Bazaar."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;&mdash;!" I exclaimed involuntarily, but
made out I was sneezing. I remembered the
conversation I had held with Harvie Price about
Mrs. Pore and the Charity Bazaar.</p>

<p>"Mother's people are noble, too. She was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
daughter of a younger son of the Earl of Garth,
but she had not a penny to her name. When
she met my Father, she was visiting some very
wealthy relatives who were interested in her and
preparing to launch her on the concert stage.
Mother had a wonderful voice, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, Harvie Price told me that all the old
sinners in your county went to church to hear
her sing."</p>

<p>"Well, Mother fell in love, too, and in spite
of all that her rich relatives had to say about
her career, she married Father; and then what
did Grandfather, Sir Isaac Pore, do but stop
Father's allowance? It was not very much but
it was enough for the young couple to live on if
they lived very simply. Sir Isaac thought he
could force Father into taking orders; but
Father was opposed to doing this, feeling he was
not suited to the Church, and Mother upheld him
in his resolve."</p>

<p>"They were right, I think. It seems an awful
sin to me for a man just to go into the ministry
for a living," I ventured.</p>

<p>"Of course they were right. Then my parents<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
were in a quandary. Father had about
two thousand dollars to his name and that
wouldn't go very far. They decided to come to
America, he to go into some kind of business and
Mother to do something with her voice. They
stayed in New York for a year. He got some
teaching, coaching boys for college, and she sang
in a church. Mother said they had a hard time.
Father's manner was proud and overbearing and
he was so intolerant of Americans that he lost
pupils constantly. Then my brother was born
and Mother had to give up her position in the
church."</p>

<p>"Oh, I did not know you had a brother!" I
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes, he died before I was born. He lived
five years, I believe. I think that is one reason
Father does not love me more. You see, all of
his hopes were settled on the boy, who was in
line for the title. My uncle, the present baronet,
has no boys. Well, they got on the best they
could until the boy died. They went from place
to place, Father always able to get pupils because
of his talents and education and always losing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
them because of his proud intolerance. Mother
had lots of tact and charm and she was always
smoothing things over and pacifying Father."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 334px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;From Mother!&quot; exclaimed the girl, trembling with excitement.&mdash;Page 156.</span>
</div>

<p>"She must have loved him a whole lot not to
have pacified him with a big stick," I thought,
but I did not give utterance to my reflection.</p>

<p>"They finally landed in Norfolk. I was born
there, so you see, I am a Virginian. While at
Norfolk, Mother heard of the country store at
Price's Landing which could be bought for very
little. She had come into possession of a small
legacy, and she immediately bought the store
and all the stock and we moved there and have
been there ever since."</p>

<p>"English people are always getting small legacies.
I never heard of Americans getting them,"
I said as I plaited Annie's hair in the great rope
that was the envy of us all.</p>

<p>"We really have prospered at Price's Landing.
Mother took charge of the store a great
deal and by her graciousness won customers,
and when once people get used to Father, they
don't seem to mind his stiffness so much; everybody
but me; somehow, I'm always afraid of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
him," and Annie looked very sadly at the crumpled
letter in her lap.</p>

<p>"Mother was so gay and cheerful; I wish I
could be like her. She would sing at her work
and Father would smile and look almost happy
when he would hear her voice."</p>

<p>"Don't you sing at your work ever?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No, no, I am so afraid of disturbing Father."</p>

<p>"I bet he'd like it. Why don't you try? Your
voice must be like your Mother's."</p>

<p>"Oh, I couldn't&mdash;really, Page. Well, to go
on:</p>

<p>"Mother used to play a lovely game with me,
and no one knew we were playing it, which made
it just so much more fun. We used to pretend
while we were keeping store that it was a Charity
Bazaar&mdash;&mdash;" (I laughed aloud) "especially
when dear old General Price came in for anything.
You see, most of the people at Price's
Landing, while very kind and good, are quite ordinary;
but General Price is very aristocratic and
fine, and we could play the game with him to
perfection. He had so much manner that sometimes
it almost seemed that he was playing, too."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
This was too delicious, and here was I sworn to
secrecy! I certainly did want to tell Harvie
Price, but a Father Confessor must keep many
good things to himself.</p>

<p>"Mother died when I was eleven." I made a
rapid calculation how long poor Annie must have
been wearing the old cr&ecirc;pe hat. "Since then,
Father and I have looked after the store together
and now we have a clerk," only Annie
called it "clark." "We are not so poor as we
used to be and the books show we are making
a very comfortable living, but Father saves and
saves. He started doing it before Mother died
and it worried her a lot. She said he used to
be a great spender and she had to do the saving,
but when money began to come more easily
he seemed to hate to part with it. She made
him promise before she died that I should go
to boarding school or I know it would never
have come about. Of course he doesn't know
how girls of the day dress and how odd I look,
but even if he did know I believe he would let me
be ridiculous rather than spend money on anything
that he considered unnecessary." Annie's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
eyes flashed, which was an improvement on the
eternal tears she seemed so prepared to shed.</p>

<p>"I am going to let you read this letter from
him so you can see," and she handed me the
crumpled sheet. It was the letter which is in
the last chapter.</p>

<p>It was certainly some letter. I could not help
comparing it with the one I had just received
from my Father, and also one that Tweedles had
read me from their Zebedee. I hardly knew
what to say but I knew what to think, and that
was that one of the so-called "vulgar Americans"
ought to give him a good beating!</p>

<p>"Well, Annie, I wouldn't mind that letter.
Your Governor evidently doesn't understand
girls. Let's have a look in the box." We cut
the string and took off the outside wrapper. The
box was tightly corded.</p>

<p>"It is just as Mother left it," sighed Annie.
"He didn't even open it to see if the things in
it were of any value for me. I'm glad he didn't,
because I like to feel that I am untying her knots
myself."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>We didn't cut those strings, but Annie carefully
and reverently picked loose the knots.
When the top was taken off the box, there was a
faint smell of dried rose leaves. The contents
were carefully wrapped in blue tissue paper.
"To keep the things from turning yellow with
age," whispered Annie.</p>

<p>I felt somehow as though I were at a funeral.
Annie didn't cry, though, as one might have expected,
but her countenance shone with a kind
of subdued light and she looked like an angel.
She shook out a soft, white, cr&ecirc;pe de Chine dress
made over silk. It looked as fresh as though
it had just come from the dressmaker's. In another
wrapper was a lovely real lace scarf and
in yet another some white silk stockings.</p>

<p>"Oh, Annie, Annie!" and I jumped up and
down for joy. "They are exactly right for you!
And see how carefully they have been packed!
Not a wrinkle in the dress! Here, take off your
clothes and try it on."</p>

<p>"Mother wore it at the Charity Bazaar where
she met Father. Her rich cousin had just had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
it made for her," and the excited child began to
take off her shabby blouse and skirt.</p>

<p>"All you will need for the concert is white
slippers and you will surely wear mine just to
let me know you love me," I begged.</p>

<p>Annie flushed and I was afraid her stubborn
pride was going to master her, but she astonished
me by saying: "Yes, I will wear them if you
will lend them to me. I remember Mother told
me she had to borrow slippers from a friend that
night, but she knew her friend loved her and so
did not mind."</p>

<p>I slipped the dress over her head, but as she
pushed her arm into the sleeve she stopped and
drew her hand quickly out.</p>

<p>"Wait, the sleeve is pinned." So it was, and
pinned through a letter that was sealed and addressed
to Annie.</p>

<p>"From Mother!" exclaimed the girl, trembling
with excitement. "Every now and then I find
a little note from her. She knew she could not
live for a long time before she died." Out fluttered
two ten-dollar bills and a five wrapped in
a tiny penciled note.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">My Darling:

<p>The time may come when you will wish to
wear this dress that I have saved so carefully
for you; and when that time comes you may also
want a little money that perhaps you will not
have, money for clothes, I mean. I give you
this twenty-five dollars for your very own, to
spend as your needs require. It is not much,
but it may help you to look like other girls.
Fathers do not always understand what girls
need, but Mothers know. I earned this
money myself, giving singing lessons to the
blacksmith's daughter and you helped me by
keeping store while I taught, so you can take
added pleasure in spending it.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span class="smcap">Mother.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>Something happened right here that was to
say the least unexpected: I, Page Allison, gave
up and cried like a baby. I know I hadn't cried
so since old Buster, my pointer, died. And Annie
Pore, instead of bawling, which she would
have been perfectly justified in doing, never shed
a tear; but with that exalted look on her face,
which she had worn from the time she opened
the box, she actually comforted me by patting
me on the back and smoothing my hair.</p>

<p>"Page, Page, it's all right; don't be so miserable,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
she said as she endeavored to soothe me.
So I blew my blooming nose and made her go
on trying on the dress. It was a wonderful fit,
just a little too long for a girl of fifteen, but we
hemmed it up in no time. Strange to say, although
the dress was more than twenty years
old, it was not out of style but cut very much
according to the prevailing mode. The truth of
the matter is that Dame Fortune is quite like
the old preacher who wrote a barrel of sermons,
and when he had preached them all, he just
turned the barrel up-side-down and began again.
Fashions and styles get put in the barrel only
to appear again after so many years.</p>

<p>"Have you a catalogue for a mail-order house,
Page? Because I want to spend my money right
off."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll get it for you just as soon as my
nose dies down a little. I don't want Tweedles
to know I've been crying. What are you going
to get?"</p>

<p>"Plenty of middy blouses and a good skirt to
wear with them, some dancing slippers and some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
kind of simple dress I can put on in the evening,
if the money can be stretched to it."</p>

<p>I was sure it could with careful ordering; and
in a few minutes I thought my nose would bear
inspection, so I went back to 117 to get the catalogue.
Tweedles was out visiting, so I did not
have to run the gauntlet of their curiosity.</p>

<p>Annie and I soon found exactly the right
things in my wonder book, and we had the letter
written ordering the things before the warning
bell rang for visiting to cease.</p>

<p>"I fancy Father would be awfully cut up if he
could know I am spending all of this money on
my clothes; but he needn't know anything about
it. I can wear my old things during the holidays
and next summer&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Annie," I broke in, "you are making an
awful mistake if you do not let your Father
know all about this letter from your Mother, and
take him into your confidence immediately. It
wouldn't be fair to him if you didn't."</p>

<p>"Not fair to Father! I never thought of such
a thing. I am afraid he will be awfully angry
with me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>"How could he be? Aren't you doing exactly
what your Mother tells you to? I tell you, honey,
it pays every time to be perfectly frank. You
try and see if it doesn't."</p>

<p>The warning bell rang and I had to beat a
hasty retreat, but before I went I kissed poor
little Annie and she clung to me and whispered:
"I know you are right and I'll write to Father
to-morrow and send him Mother's letter."</p>

<p>"That's a good girl; but, Annie, get your
letter off to New York for your things first before
the Governor has time to veto it."</p>

<p>"Well, what ho!" exclaimed the twins as they
tore in to our rooms, undressing as they came
to beat the lights out bell to bed. "Tell us all
about Annie!"</p>

<p>"There's nothing to tell," I declared, making
the mental reservation that there was nothing
I could tell, "except that her father sent her a
pretty white cr&ecirc;pe de Chine dress that she is
going to look charming in, and she has consented
to borrow my white slippers for the occasion."</p>

<p>"Oh, how splendid!" cried Dum. But Dee
looked at me very solemnly and said: "Page<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Allison, I know where to put my confidence.
Annie Pore has told you the story of her life
and wild horses could not drag it from you. I
wouldn't have even known she had told if your
precious little freckled nose wasn't as red as a
cherry." I felt awfully foolish but I borrowed
my policy from the Tar Baby "an' kep' on sayin'
nothin'."</p>

<p>After the light was out, I gave a little audible
chuckle as I lay there going over in my mind the
very exciting happenings of the evening. I
chuckled to think what Mabel Binks would say
if she knew the despised "Orphan Annie" was
the granddaughter of a baronet on her father's
side and the great-granddaughter of an earl on
her mother's.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE CONCERT.</div>


<p>The concert was a great affair. They had not
only the singing and playing from the musical
pupils, but refreshments afterward and a little
reception. Many of the townspeople came and
the boys from Hill-Top. Our Assembly Hall
was full to overflowing. Miss Jane Cox was in
a highly nervous state.</p>

<p>"I have two pupils who will sing flat," she confided
to me, "and if they do it to-night, I'll die
of mortification."</p>

<p>"Well, Annie Pore is going to do you credit,
anyhow, I feel sure," I said, hoping Miss Cox
would take a more cheerful view.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am looking to her to save the day.
Have you seen her? She looks beautiful."</p>

<p>I had seen her; in fact, I had hooked her up.
My slippers fitted finely and Annie's dress was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
without doubt the best-looking one on the stage
that evening.</p>

<p>Mabel Binks headed the programme with a
flashy selection on the piano. She was in her
element, showing off. Everything about her proclaimed
<i>le dernier cri</i> of fashion. Even her hair
was the latest creation of twists and rolls. Her
hands were covered with rings and her arms
had several bracelets in the form of snakes coiling
around them. These rings and bracelets had
a way of clicking ever so slightly but just enough
to accentuate the effect that her performance
was a purely mechanical one.</p>

<p>"Pianola," whispered Dee to me. Dee and I
had captured dear old Captain Leahy and made
him sit between us. The old fellow was in fine
feather and full of jokes. Miss Peyton smiled
approval when she saw that we had taken care
of her old friend, who always came to the school
entertainments by her especial invitation.</p>

<p>"And do ye call that music? I'd rather hear
'Sweet bye and bye' played on the whistle of an
engine by a freight engineer on our line than
that rattle bang. The freight engineer puts some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
sowl into his worrk, some meaning. He wants
to let his frinds know he is a-cooming home, and
his wife to know that 'tis toime to put on the
frying pan and get the pot to b'iling. But that,
what does that mean? Nothing but nimble fingers.
There's no heart in it,&mdash;just noise."</p>

<p>We heartily agreed with the old man, but at
the close of Mabel's performance there was such
a storm of applause from the Juniors who were
her especial admirers that the perfunctory clapping
from the rest of the audience was completely
drowned. She bowed and smiled and rattled
her bangles and then sat down and played
"Annie Laurie" with her foot on the loud pedal
all the time, and with all the variations possible
to weave around the beautiful old air.</p>

<p>"Now isn't that too Mabel Binksy for anything?"
hissed Dum in my ear. She was right
behind us sitting next to Harvie Price, who had
sought us out on his arrival at Gresham. "She
knows perfectly well that Annie Pore is to sing
'Annie Laurie,' and she chose that for her encore
deliberately and without the knowledge of
Miss Cox or the piano teacher, either. Cat!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>"And why should ye insult poor pussy so, Miss
Tucker?" asked the Captain, who had overheard
Dum's remark. "I haven't a cat to me name
who would do such a trick."</p>

<p>Annie followed Mabel immediately. I wondered
if she would be upset by Mabel's having
just played her song, but she was not a whit.
She whispered to Miss Cox, who was to play her
accompaniment and they evidently decided to
change the program.</p>

<p>As Annie came on the stage, I verily believe
half of the girls did not at first recognize her.
Her dress had that unmistakable air that a good
dressmaker can give, and twenty years had not
diminished the style; but it was Annie's walk
and manner that astonished everyone, even her
best friends. Could this be the same, tearful
little Annie? She wasn't really little, but I always
had thought of her as small just because
she seemed to need protection. She was quite
as well grown as the Tuckers and a little larger
than I was. Her carriage had dignity, and there
was a poise and ease to her that is rare in a
school girl. Miss Cox played the opening bars<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
to Tom Moore's beautiful and touching song,
"Believe me if all those endearing young
charms," and Annie sang with the simplicity
and confidence of a great artist.</p>

<div class='poem'>
Believe me, if all those endearing young charms,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which I gaze on so fondly to-day,</span><br />
Were to change by to-morrow and fleet in my arms,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like fairy gifts fading away,</span><br />
Thou wouldst still be adored, as this moment thou art,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Let thy loveliness fade as it will,</span><br />
And around the dear ruin each wish of my heart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would entwine itself verdantly still.</span><br />
<br />
It is not while beauty and youth are thine own,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thy cheek unprofaned by a tear,</span><br />
That the fervor and faith of a soul may be known,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To which time will but make thee more dear!</span><br />
No, the heart that has truly loved never forgets,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But as truly loves on to the close,</span><br />
As the sunflower turns to her god when he sets<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The same look which she turned when he rose.</span><br />
</div>

<p>There is something in that song that touches
everyone, old and young. As Annie finished,
for a moment there was perfect silence and then
such an ovation as the little English girl did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
have! Old Captain Leahy beat his peg leg on
the floor. "Forgetting me manners in me enthusiasm,"
he declared. Annie bowed and smiled,
no more flustrated than Alma Gluck would have
been.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see such stage presence?" whispered
Dee. "Why, she is more at home there
than we are in 117 in our kimonos."</p>

<p>"That's because she loves to sing and knows
she can do it," and at the risk of being considered
Annie's claque, I started fresh applause
which was taken up by the whole audience; and
after another whispered conference with Miss
Cox, Annie sang again. This time it was "Bonnie,
sweet Bessie, the maid of Dundee." These
were songs her mother had taught her, and I
could almost fancy the spirit of the mother had
entered into the daughter.</p>

<p>"I could almost see her mother as she sang,"
Harvie Price said to me later on. "I believe Annie's
voice is going to be stronger than her mother's
and it has the same note of pathos in it.
Why, it was all I could do to keep from sobbing
when she sang 'Sweet Bessie.' And did you see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Shorty? Why, Shorty had his face buried in
his hands, and now he pretends he has caught a
bad cold! Isn't she pretty, too? The old man
must have loosened up some to get that swell
dress for her. Grandfather wrote me the other
day that Mr. Pore is so economical these days
that he won't go to church because he does not
want to part with his nickel. He says he is making
money, too, on the store, since there is absolutely
no competition at the Landing."</p>

<p>"I am so glad you liked her dress," I answered,
nearly dead to tell this nice, sympathetic
boy all about it; but keeping to my role of Father
Confessor, I naturally said nothing about how
she came by it.</p>

<p>"I am hoping I can spend part of next summer
with my grandfather," continued Harvey.
"You know my Governor and his Father fell
out about politics and I had to stop going there,
but, thank goodness, they have made up now.
Father would vote for Roosevelt, while Grandfather
thinks anybody belonging to him must be
a Democrat. And not long ago Father decided
that President Wilson was, after all, about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
best President we have ever had, so he wrote to
Grandfather and said he was sorry he had ever
voted for a Republican; and now the row is over
and the family is reunited. Grandfather is very
arbitrary and of course it is hard to live with
him, but he is the kindest and most generous old
man, and I truly love him."</p>

<p>"Annie Pore says he is charming and delightful
and that her mother cared so much for him,"
I said, feeling that that much of Annie's talk
with me it would be all right to repeat. This
conversation with Harvie was after the concert
when we were having refreshments in the Gymnasium.
The concert had gone off very well.
Miss Cox was jubilant because her pupils who
would sing flat had refrained for the occasion.
Miss Cox herself had sung delightfully and had
won the heart of old Captain Leahy by giving
"The Wearing of the Green" as an encore.</p>

<p>When the programme was all over and everyone
had done the best she could, Miss Peyton
made a little speech and said that by especial request
from some of the older guests Miss Annie
Pore was to sing "Annie Laurie."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>That was really the treat of the evening. We
were delighted because it made Mabel Binks so
mad.</p>

<p>"I am some weary of that sob stuff from 'Orphan
Annie,'" I heard her say to one of the
Hill-Top boys.</p>

<p>"Why, I think it is great!" was his unsympathetic
reply. "And what a little beauty she is,
too!"</p>

<p>Once off the stage, Annie's shyness returned
in full force, but it soon wore off under the genial
good fellowship of the Tuckers and Mary Flannigan,
and Harvie's big-brother air of pride in
her success, and Shorty's funny reproaches for
making him catch such a bad cold. She looked
very happy, and not even Mabel Binks could mar
her cheerfulness, although she plainly heard
Mabel say to a Junior: "I wonder who lent her
that dress. It certainly looks familiar to me and
anyone could see it was shortened for the occasion."</p>

<p>My stitches were not so small as they might
have been!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE SPREAD.</div>


<p>Saturday night was a great time for spreads
as there was no study hall on that evening and
the girls could come early and stay late. A
grand feast was in preparation at 117 Carter
Hall. Mr. Tucker had sent a box that had
passed inspection at the office, although it was
filled with contraband articles; but as he wrote
Tweedles, they wouldn't make rules if they did
not expect them to be broken.</p>

<p>"My, I'm glad Miss Peyton doesn't put us on
our honor not to have cake and such," said Dee
as she opened up a box stamped with the name
of a well-known drygoods firm and plainly
marked in a masculine hand: "Virginia's Shoes,
the fourth pair she has had since Spring and she
must be more careful and have her old ones half-soled."</p>

<p>"Isn't old Zebedee a peach? Look! Tango<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
sandwiches!" (The catalogue to Gresham plainly
says: "Nothing but crackers, fruit and simple
candy is allowed to be eaten in the rooms.")</p>

<p>"Here are olives done up to look like shoe polish,"
said I, diving into the big box. "And what
is this big round parcel at the bottom?" On it
I read: "Caroline's winter hat. I think you
are a very vain girl to insist on your winter hat
just to wear it home on the train for Christmas.
I hope it is not mashed but think it would serve
you right for thinking so much about your appearance."
The hat proved to be a great caramel
cake, stuck all over with English walnuts,
packed so carefully it was not a bit mashed. Jars
of pickle masqueraded shamelessly as Uneeda
Biscuit, being ingeniously pasted up in the original
wrappers. Cream cheese and pimento sandwiches
came dressed as graham wafers; and a
whole roasted chicken had had a very comfortable
journey buttoned up in Dum's old sweater,
with a note pinned over its faithful breast saying
that Dum must make out with that sweater
for another season as Mr. Tucker could not put
up with her selfish extravagance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>We heard afterward that Miss Sears, whose
duty it had been to inspect this box before it
was delivered to the girls, had said that she was
surprised to find that Mr. Jeffry Tucker did not
spoil the twins nearly so much as she had been
led to believe. In fact, he seemed to be rather
strict with them and quite critical. For instance,
an old sweater that he expected Dum to wear
through the season was not really fit to be seen
in!</p>

<p>There were several boxes of candy, besides all
the other goodies. They were all marked peppermint
but were really candied fruit, chocolates,
nougat and what not.</p>

<p>"I tell you, Zebedee is some provider when he
gets started," said Dee. "I'm glad I didn't eat
much dinner and I intend to eat no supper at
all."</p>

<p>We were taking stock of our eatables before
supper bell so we could see how many girls we
could invite to the spread. It was etiquette at
Gresham to give a girl fair warning when a
spread was under way, so she could save space
and not go and fill up in the dining-room. We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
wanted to avoid feeling like the old countryman
who had his first experience with a table d'h&ocirc;te
dinner. Not knowing there was to be so much
following the first course, he ate too much of
it, and afterward loudly lamented: "Thar I sot
chock full er soup."</p>

<p>Annie Pore was, of course, on the list and
funny little Mary Flannigan and the two Seniors,
Sally Coles and Josephine Barr. They had been
especially nice to our crowd and we were anxious
to show them some attention. That made seven
in all.</p>

<p>"We've really got food for one more or even
two," declared Dee, "but maybe we had better
go easy because there is really not room for
more."</p>

<p>117 was rather crowded with the three beds,
two bureaus, three chairs and a table, and
seven girls would just about fill it to overflowing.
It did not look like the bare cell that
had so appalled us on our day of entering
Gresham. We now had a scrim curtain at the
window; rugs on the floor; Tweedles had pretty
Roman blankets on their beds with bright sofa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
cushions; while I had a beautiful log cabin quilt
that Sally Winn had pieced for me in between
her different death throes. The walls were literally
covered with pennants from many schools
and colleges with a few pictures that Dum had
stuck in her trunk, purloined from their apartment
in Richmond.</p>

<p>"I don't believe Zebedee will ever miss them,
and they mean a lot to me," she had said when
Dee had expressed astonishment on her producing
them from her trunk. "I am so constituted
that I've just got to have something beautiful
to look at every now and then." The room was
pleasant and cozy but the crowded walls rather
got on my nerves. Bracken was so big and simple
(some people would have called it bare) that
I could not get used to such a conglomeration
in a bedroom. I kept my taste to myself, however,
as they were two to one, and no doubt my
ideas of decoration were very old-fashioned and
out of date.</p>

<p>Sally Coles and Jo Barr, whom we sought out
before supper, were glad to accept and vowed
they would eat not a bite before the feast so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
that they could come perfectly empty. Of course
Annie Pore and Mary Flannigan were holding
themselves in readiness for the arrival of the
promised box from Mr. Tucker, and the news
of its having come safely to hand was greeted
with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>You get tired of any steady food except home
food and sometimes you think you are tired of
that, but as a rule you are pretty glad to get
back to it. I fancy the table at Gresham was
kept up about as well as any boarding school,
but we knew that as sure as Tuesday was coming,
roast veal was coming, too; and Wednesday
would bring with it veal potpie; Thursday, beefsteak;
and Friday, fish; Saturday, lamb stew
with dumplings; Sunday, roast chicken; and
Monday, not much of anything. This certainty
bored us, and sometimes I used to think if I
couldn't find something in the potpie besides
veal, I'd scream. I had to do a lot of looking
at the mountains on Wednesday, somehow.</p>

<p>A spread was a godsend, and an invitation to
one was not as a rule given in vain. As Sally
Coles and I fox-trotted together in the Gym<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
after supper, she whispered in my ear: "It's
certainly good of you kids to ask Jo and me.
We're crazy about coming."</p>

<p>"We think it's pretty nice of you Seniors to
come. You didn't even know we are to have
caramel cake, either, did you?" I answered.</p>

<p>"Heavens, no! I'm mighty glad we didn't accept
Mabel Binks's bid to a Welsh rarebit in her
room. We fibbed and told her we had a partial
engagement. It was just with each other but
we didn't tell her that, and now you Sophomores
have saved our souls by making our imaginary
engagement a real one. I hate to tell even a
white lie, but I'd hate a deal more to have to go
to a spread of Mabel Binks's giving. Don't you
know the hammers will be flying to-night? Can't
you hear Mabel and those rapid Juniors she runs
with knocking everything and everybody?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I reckon the only way to save your skin
is to stay with her and help knock. But how
does she manage a rarebit when we are not allowed
to have chafing dishes?"</p>

<p>"Manages the same way you and the Tuckers
manage to have caramel cake, I fancy. We are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
not allowed to have cake, either. Of course it
is easier to hide a cake than it is a chafing dish,
especially if the cake is sliced and there are a
half-dozen empty girls to help. I believe some
of the girls keep their chafing dishes under their
mattresses. Did you hide your cake well before
you came down to supper? It would be the
psychological moment for some busybody to
make an inspecting tour&mdash;and then, good-by,
cake!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you scare me to death!" and I grabbed
Dee, who was whirling by, trying a brand new
step with a giddy Junior, and, whispering Sally's
warning to her, we beat a hasty retreat. Our
beloved cake was on the table covered with a
napkin just as we had left it, seemingly, but on
raising the cloth we discovered that a great
wedge had been cut out of it.</p>

<p>"Well, of all the mean tricks!" spluttered Dee.
"Who do you s'pose&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Thank goodness, they only took about a
fourth! What is left is enough to give all seven
of us fever blisters. Caramel cake with nuts in
it always gives me fever blisters," I laughed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I don't mind. I'll take the cake, fever blisters
and all, every time."</p>

<p>"Me, too! Well, I hope that the thief will
have a mouth full of them," said Dee vindictively.</p>

<p>"Well, honey, it's a sight better to have some
mean girl take off one fourth than some teacher
in her mistaken zeal take off the whole thing
and give us demerits, besides. Here's your
handkerchief," I said, picking up a little pink
cr&ecirc;pe de Chine one from the floor.</p>

<p>"Not mine, I don't possess such a thing.
Don't you know Zebedee and Dum and I use the
same sized handkerchiefs? When we want a
handkerchief, we want a handkerchief, not a
little pink dab. It must be yours."</p>

<p>"No, I haven't any cr&ecirc;pe de Chine ones.
Here's an initial&mdash;B. It certainly is scented up."
The finishing touch to Mabel Binks's costume on
the afternoon we had seen the game at Hill-Top
came back to me suddenly: the strong odor of
musk. The handkerchief smelt exactly the same
way.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, Dee, I reckon it won't take a Sherlock
Holmes to say who took the cake, now. Let's
not give her back her hanky until to-morrow.
If we took it to her to-night she would know that
we are on to her, and she would be just mean
enough to peach on us and have our cake seized."
So we determined, like Dee and Prosper le Gai,
to "bide our time."</p>

<p>What a spread we did have and what fun!
Dum turned up with two more girls, members
of our class, and there was enough and to spare.
Mr. Tucker was as lavish as Mammy Susan herself.
We had no plates or glasses, but we had
plenty of box tops for dishes and our toothbrush
mugs served as loving cups to drink the very
sour lemonade Dee made in the water pitcher.
The same knife carved the chicken, then cut the
cake. The olives, always difficult to extract from
the bottle, were poured into the soap dish which
I had scoured hard enough to suit the most
squeamish.</p>

<p>"My, what good eats!" exclaimed Jo Barr.
"And how did you ever smuggle that cake within<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
the lines?" We showed her the wrapper it had
come in and the stern note from Mr. Tucker.</p>

<p>"Well, if that doesn't beat all! I tell you there
is nothing like being smart enough to keep the
eleventh commandment: 'Thou shalt not get
found out.' I had a whole fruitcake taken bodaciously
from me last year. I am always breaking
the eleventh." And that was so. Poor Jo
always got caught up with.</p>

<p>"Well, I tell you one thing," said the wise
Sally, "that cake had better skidoo until danger
of inspection passes. Teachers are a suspicious
lot."</p>

<p>I just got it whisked under a down cushion on
Dee's bed when there was a sharp rap on the
door. "Come in," we called in a chorus. It was
Miss Sears, rather astonished at our ready invitation
to enter.</p>

<p>"Oh, girls, having a spread, are you," glancing
sharply at the innocent-looking packages of
crackers and peppermint candy without coming
all the way into the room. "Well, I hope you
will have a nice time."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>"Won't you join us, Miss Sears?" asked Dum
sweetly.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, no. I am on inspection duty
to-night," and she closed the door, never seeing
that Jo had wrapped the roasted chicken up in
a spangled scarf she was sporting. That chicken
had had all kinds of dressing in its fat, young
life: first its own feathers; then the dressing,
which is really the un-dressing; then the dressing,
which is really the stuffing; then Dum's old
sweater; and now Jo's fine scarf.</p>

<p>We proceeded then to put the good, appetizing
food where nothing short of an X-ray could
inspect. So thorough were those nine girls that
not a crumb of cake nor scrap of sandwich was
left to tell on us. The chicken bones were some
problem but we decided that if each girl took a
bone and disposed of it, it would simplify matters
somewhat. Sally got the wishbone and said
she was going to gild it and put it on her "memory
string."</p>

<p>When we had eaten to repletion, we demanded
stunts from those gifted that way. Mary did a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
dog fight and new turn she had just mastered:
going like a mouse.</p>

<p>"I wish I could think it was a mouse who nibbled
the cake," sighed Dum. "It kind of hurts
me all over to feel that somebody did it."</p>

<p>"Well, if it was a mouse, I bet it sounded like
this," and Mary imitated Mabel Binks's nasal
speech until we almost had hysterics.</p>

<p>"Why do you fancy she took only a hunk instead
of the whole cake?" I asked. "It would
have been so much more like her to take it all."</p>

<p>"That's the reason she only took part. She
thought by behaving out of character she would
throw us off the scent," suggested Sally.</p>

<p>"Well, if she wanted to throw us off the scent,
she shouldn't have dropped her handkerchief,"
said Dee. "But let's forget it and think of something
pleasant. Annie, you sing, please," and
she handed Jo's guitar to the blushing Annie.
Annie was always embarrassed when she had to
sing before a few persons. She got her "stage
presence" when there was a real audience.</p>

<p>"What shall it be?" asked Annie.</p>

<p>"Oh, something real sentimental and lovesick,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
demanded Sally, who was supposed to be engaged;
and with a little humorous twinkle in
her usually sad eyes, Annie sang "Sally in our
Alley."</p>

<div class='poem'>
Of all the girls that are so smart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There's none like pretty Sally;</span><br />
She is the darling of my heart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And she lives in our alley.</span><br />
There is no lady in the land<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is half so sweet as Sally;</span><br />
She is the darling of my heart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And she lives in our alley.</span><br />
<br />
Of all the days that's in the week<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I dearly love but one day&mdash;</span><br />
And that's the day that comes betwixt<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A Saturday and Monday;</span><br />
For then I'm dressed all in my best<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To walk abroad with Sally;</span><br />
She is the darling of my heart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And she lives in our alley.</span><br />
</div>

<p>Then Dum and Dee stood back to back and
buttoned themselves up in their sweaters, which
they had put on hindpart-before and impersonated
the two-headed woman, Milly-Christine,
singing a duet, "The mocking bird is singing
o'er her grave," in two distinct keys. That was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
an awfully funny stunt and one the Tuckers
had made up themselves. Before we had half
exhausted the talent of the assembled guests, the
bell rang to warn us that lights must soon be out
and we had to break up.</p>

<p>The next morning there was a fine crop of
fever blisters due to the very rich cake. Annie
Pore and Sally Coles were the only ones who
escaped with a whole skin. When I handed Mabel
Binks her smelly, pink, cr&ecirc;pe de Chine handkerchief,
I noticed that her rather full lips were
decorated with a design similar to my own.</p>

<p>"Here's your handkerchief," I said. "Cake
with caramel and nut filling is awfully rough on
the complexion, isn't it?" And the girl had the
decency to blush.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS.</div>


<p>I could hardly believe that it was I, Page Allison,
who had been off to boarding school.
Bracken was so exactly as I left it and I dropped
so easily into my old habits and customs, that I
felt as though I had only dreamed I had been
away. The dogs almost ate me up for joy, and
Mammy Susan had three kinds of hot bread for
supper. Father and I chatted away for dear
life for a while, and then we just as naturally
settled down to a quiet evening of reading, as
though I had merely been over to Milton to mail
a letter. He was vastly pleased to have me back,
and every now and then looked over his glasses
at me with a very happy smile on his dear, old,
lean, weather-beaten face; and I lay curled up
in a big Sleepy-Hollow chair simply devouring
the last "Saturday Evening Post" that I had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
bought on the train coming from Gresham, feeling
that I had about the pleasantest home and
the best father and kindest Mammy Susan and
the finest dogs on earth.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tucker tells me you have asked him
down to hunt," I said as I surprised a loving
glance from Father.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I thought it would be nice if he
could come when his girls pay you their promised
visit. He is mighty good company. I declare
he can keep a whole party in a good humor,"
and Father chuckled, evidently in remembrance
of some witticism of Mr. Tucker's. "We
are thinking of getting up a deer hunt over in
the swamp. Jo Winn shot a good-sized buck
last month and I am told a great many persons
have seen deer in the distance lately."</p>

<p>This was over in a corner of our county where
many small rivers and creeks formed a perfect
network, making very inaccessible, marshy land.
The hunting was as a rule pretty good and during
the winter we feasted quite royally on wild
turkey, partridge and rabbit. Deer, of course,
were not so plentiful, but an occasional one was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
shot. It seems strange that Virginia, the first
state settled, should still be boasting big game.</p>

<p>"I wish you could take us. Dum and Dee
would like it a lot."</p>

<p>"And you, I fancy, would just go along out of
politeness," he teased.</p>

<p>"Well, you know I'd rather get killed myself
than kill anything, but the Tuckers have their
own guns and often go hunting with their father.
I believe they are very good shots."</p>

<p>"If you think they can stand the trip, we'll
take them. I know you can stand what I can
stand, unless boarding school has made you soft.
Let me feel your arm&mdash;ah, as hard as ever."</p>

<p>"That's basketball and gym work. I'd have
been soft, indeed, if I hadn't gone in for athletics.
I'm so glad we can go. I'll write to the
twins to bring their guns and rough clothes."</p>

<p>Christmas day came and went with plenty of
good cheer and happiness, but none of the hurry
and bustle of the present-day Christmas in
town. At Bracken we knew nothing about white
tissue paper and Christmas seals and bolts of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
red and green ribbon. Our simple gifts to one
another were exchanged without much ceremony;
and then Father and I got into his buggy,
with the colt ready to run twenty miles if he
could get the bit between his teeth, and distributed
baskets and bags of candy, nuts and
oranges to our many poor neighbors, colored and
white. We always had a box of oranges for the
holidays and simple candy and mixed nuts by
wholesale quantities.</p>

<p>"I'd like to take these things around on Christmas
Eve and let the little children think Santa
Claus brought them, but I know the mothers
would give them their share right away and then
there would be nothing for Christmas day."</p>

<p>"Well, I believe they think 'Docallison' is a
kind of Santy, anyhow," I said, as we whizzed up
to a particularly poor-looking cabin that seemed
to be simply running over with little nigs. The
grimy window was black with their dusky faces
and the doorway was so full that the children in
front were being pushed out onto the rickety
excuse for a porch.</p>

<p>"Howdy, Aunt Keziah! I hope you and your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
family are well this beautiful morning," called
Father, pulling in the colt and taking from between
his knees a large hamper literally running
over with sweets.</p>

<p>"Chris'mus gif'! Chris'mus gif'!" came in a
chorus from all the little mouths. Aunt Keziah
hobbled out, smacking the little blacks as
she came with a very horny hand; but they
seemed to take it as a kind of pleasantry and
bobbed up grinning from ear to ear.</p>

<p>"Shet ep, yer lims er Satan! Cyarn't yer see
Docallison's colt ain't go'nter stan fer no sich
yellin's? Chris'mus gif', Docallison! Chris'mus
gif', Miss Page!"</p>

<p>This last came with a voice as soft as the
wings of a dove, while the tone in which she
had admonished the little darkies had been as
rough as a nutmeg grater. You could hardly
believe the two voices had issued from the same
lips. Aunt Keziah was the neighborhood "Tender":
that is, she minded the children whose natural
guardians had gone away for one reason
or another,&mdash;sometimes to work in the cities,
sometimes as house servants for the county families,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
where such encumbrances as offspring were
not welcome. She was paid a small sum for
each child and always spoke of them as "bo'ders."</p>

<p>Aunt Keziah had her charity, too, (as who
has not?) and supported several orphans. These
she treated with especial kindness, and always
made the "bo'ders" wait until the objects of charity
were helped to "ash-cake an' drippin's."</p>

<p>Father lifted out the heavy basket and the
pickaninnies swarmed like flies around a molasses
barrel.</p>

<p>"Git back, thar, you kinky-haided Gabe. You
know you ain't nothin' but a bo'der. You let
dis here lil orphant Minnie git fust grab," and
Gabe got back and Minnie came proudly up and
got her bag of candy and nuts. We had tied the
treat up in separate packages so there could be
no broken hearts. Mammy Susan had reported
that Aunt Keziah had two new ones, Milly Jourdan's
twins, making fourteen in all.</p>

<p>"What did you name the twins, your new
boarders, Aunt Keziah?" I asked.</p>

<p>Aunt Keziah demanded one thing from her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
patrons and that was that she be allowed to name
her charges. No matter what their names had
been up to the time they entered her domain,
they had to be rechristened. A big boy who
had been called Bill for eight winters was now
known as Clarence. Mary Banks was Chrystobel
and Mump Davis, a raw-boned, fiery-looking
boy, part Indian, seethed and chafed under
the <i>nom de guerre</i> of Fermentation. The charity
orphans kept the names their mothers had
seen fit to give them, out of respect for the departed.</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Page, I studied a long time 'bout
them thar twins. Naming is moughty important
fer boys special, sence matrimony cyarn't in no
way improve 'em, an' I done decided to call 'em
Postle Peter an' Pistle Paul."</p>

<p>"Capital, capital!" laughed Father. "I hope
Postle Peter and Pistle Paul are healthy. You
raise the strongest children in the county, Aunt
Keziah."</p>

<p>"Yassir, Docallison," said the old woman with
a toothless grin. "They's a right likely pair.
The reason my bo'ders an' all is so healthy is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
'cause I make 'em wash theyselves. An' ev'y
las' one er 'em is gotter have two shuts or shifts
to they backs er I won't tend 'em. An' what
they ain't a wearin', I puts in a pot an' biles.
De boys gits a big washin' on Chusdays an'
Fridays, an' de gals on Wednesdays an' Sat'days.
Sometimes whin de lil gals all gits washed
of a Sat'day night, it looks like it's a kinder pity
to was'e all them hot suds what ain't ter say
dirty, so I picks out a boy er so dat done got
siled some, and makes him take a extra scrub,
jist fer luck. As fer eatin's, dey don't git nothin'
but corn braid an' drippin's wif lasses on Sunday
ef I kin make out to have 'em, but dey gits a
plenty of what dey do git and de victuals 'grees
wif 'em, an' I don't never have a nigger a month
'fo he's as fat as a possum."</p>

<p>"Well, Aunt Keziah, you are doing a fine
work, raising healthy citizens. I hope you will
have a happy Christmas and a prosperous New
Year. There are toys enough to go around in
the bottom of the basket and here's a pound of
tea for you and some tobacco for your pipe and
some chocolate drops that are easy to chew."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank yer, thank yer. Docallison, specially
fer de sof' candy. I always did useter have a
sweet tooth but now I ain't got nothin' but a
sweet gum, but I's got dat all right."</p>

<p>Just then the colt, tired of standing, made a
bolt and all we could do was to wave good-by
to the funny old woman and her fourteen
charges.</p>

<p>"Old Aunt Keziah is bringing up those children
according to the teachings of modern science,
even to sterilizing their shirts and shifts,
and she doesn't know there is such a word as
germ. I fancy the many cracks in the cabin
wall where you can see daylight are partly responsible
for the health of the 'bo'ders.' I find
more sickness among the colored people where
their cabins are better built and airtight. Ventilation
is avoided like the plague," said Father
as he got the colt under control and we went
spinning off to some more "pensioners," as he
called them.</p>

<p>The doctor's buggy was finally emptied of its
load and we skimmed back home with the colt
as fresh as ever, agreeing that we would not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
give up horses for all the automobiles under the
sun. There is an exhilaration that comes from
driving a good horse that I do not believe a
car can give one, no matter how fine the car or
expert the driver.</p>

<p>Mammy Susan had a dinner for us that was
fit for kings and queens. It seemed a pity to
cook so much for just Father and me, but some
of that dinner found its way to many a cabin
where Father felt it was most needed; and then
on Christmas Day the dogs were given extra
rations and not limited to their one big feeding
of corn meal and salt, scalded and baked in a
great pan until it was crisp. On this day of
days they had a bone apiece and all kinds of
good scrapings.</p>

<p>After dinner we settled ourselves to enjoy the
Christmas books, of which there were many, as
our tastes were well known. Father's patients
were considerate enough not to send for him all
afternoon. Not a soul got sick on this happy
Christmas day. Even poor Sally Winn did not
try to die.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A VISIT FROM THE TUCKERS.</div>


<p>The Tuckers arrived, and Tucker-like, neither
at the time nor by the route expected. I was
just calling Sam to hitch Peg (short for Pegasus)
to the surrey to drive to Milton to meet
them, when the unaccustomed toot of an automobile
attracted my attention. It was tearing
down our avenue at breakneck speed. Dee was
at the wheel with Mr. Tucker beside her, and
Dum was bouncing around alone on the back
seat.</p>

<p>"Beat the train! By Jove, I thought we
could!" exclaimed Mr. Tucker, when he spied
me at the yard gate. "We were so afraid you
might have started for Milton. That's the reason
we were violating the speed limit," and they
all piled out, the girls hugging me and kissing
me and Mr. Tucker almost hugging me and not
quite kissing me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was such a grand day we couldn't resist
coming in the car," tweedled the twins, "but if
you had started for Milton before we got here,
we would have died of mortification."</p>

<p>When I told them I had not even had Peg
hitched up yet, they were delighted.</p>

<p>"A mounted policeman chased us just as we
were leaving Manchester, but we dusted him so
Tweedles and I are hoping he did not get our
number," said Mr. Tucker.</p>

<p>I called Sam to bring in the grips and rugs.</p>

<p>"I am sorry he can't take your steed around
to the stable, Mr. Tucker, but we don't know a
thing about automobiles at Bracken."</p>

<p>"Leave it where it is, maybe we can have a
spin later on."</p>

<p>We went into the house, where the open wood
fires made everything bright and cheerful, although
not very warm for persons who are accustomed
to steam heat. Mammy Susan in a
stiffly starched purple calico dress with a gay
bandanna handkerchief on her head was ready
to greet the guests.</p>

<p>"Well, bress the Lord, an' you done come all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the way from town in that there fire wagon. I
hearn the horn a tootin' and a rushin' like
mighty wings, and I says, says I: 'Susan Collins,
'tis the Angel Gabr'el a comin' fer you.' So
I clap on my clean head hankcher an' a starched
apron tow be ready fer the Resrection."</p>

<p>"Mammy Susan, we've heard a lot about you.
Page talks about you all the time at school,"
said the twins, shaking the old woman warmly
by the hand.</p>

<p>"Well, now, does she? Mammy's baby don't
fergit her any more'n Mammy fergits her baby.
An' is this your pa? Well, save us, ef you don't
look more like somebody's great-grandson than
anybody's pa."</p>

<p>"Well, they do treat me like a stepson, sometimes,
Mammy," laughed Mr. Tucker. "If I
could only take on the looks of years without
the years, I'd be glad, and maybe I could command
more respect."</p>

<p>"Why don't you grow some whiskers, then?
They ain't nothin' so ageyfying as whiskers on
a young man."</p>

<p>"I'll do it, I'll do it!" exclaimed Mr. Tucker.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, and you do and we'll pull 'em out,"
Tweedles declared.</p>

<p>"Well, here am I a-gassin' when I ought to be
settin' a little lunch fer the travelers."</p>

<p>"Oh, we had lunch on the way," the three of
them declared. "We were not going to be any
trouble to you by coming so much earlier than
we were expected."</p>

<p>"Oh, now, you must be hungry," I said. "It
won't take Mammy Susan a minute."</p>

<p>"Cose they's hungry, child. Can't I tell hungry
folks soon as I claps eyes on 'em? Maybe they
did eat a snack in that there chariot of fire, but
the way they come down the abenue was enough
to jolt down a Christmus dinner, plum puddin'
an' all, an' plum puddin' takes a heap er joltin',"
and Mammy Susan hastened out to "set a little
lunch,"&mdash;which the Tuckers later declared was
a feast.</p>

<p>They were hungry and cold, in spite of their
protestations to the contrary, and cold turkey
and country ham with the delicious little cornmeal
cakes that Mammy could stir up and bake
in half a minute disappeared like magic.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>"Such coffee!" and Mr. Tucker rolled up his
eyes in ecstasy. "And real cow cream! I tell
you, Tweedles, as soon as you finish getting this
much needed education, we've got to get out of
an apartment and into a house where we can
do some real housekeeping and have some home
cooking."</p>

<p>"You ought to be made to eat at Gresham for
a month or so, Zebedee, and you would think the
caf&eacute; is pretty fine," said Dee. "The grub at
Gresham is not so bad, but there is such a deadly
sameness to it."</p>

<p>"Well, the grub may be tejus," broke in
Mammy, who had just come in with a heaped-up
plate of corn cakes, "but it must hab suption
in it, 'cause lil Miss Page is growd in width as
well as wisdom, and you two young twin ladies
is got cheeks like wine-saps."</p>

<p>"You are right, Mammy, the food must be
pretty good to keep them so fat and rosy," said
Mr. Tucker, helping himself plentifully to the
dainty little cakes.</p>

<p>"Yassir," and Mammy had a sly twinkle in
her kind old eyes, "an' that there caffy whar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
you gits yo' victuals mus' be dishin' out some
nourishment, too, 'cause you ain't to say peaked
lookin'."</p>

<p>How we did laugh at Zebedee, and as for him,
he got up and gave Mammy a little hug. The
Tuckers all knew how to take jokes on themselves.</p>

<p>"She certainly did get you, Zebedee," teased
Dum. "You were trying to be so Mr. Tuckerish,
too, admonishing Dee and me for complaining
about the food at Gresham."</p>

<p>Father came in soon from his rounds and
greeted the visitors in his kindly hospitable way.
Mr. Tucker was to have several days' holiday
from his newspaper and Father said the neighborhood
was in an extremely healthy condition,
owing to the clear, cold weather, and he did not
expect to be overworked; so the gentlemen began
immediately to plan their hunts. Dum and Dee
were wild at the prospect of going on the deer
hunt.</p>

<p>"I saw Jo Winn this morning, daughter," said
Father, "and he will go with us. He has a cousin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
from New York who is visiting him and he
wants to take him."</p>

<p>"Well, if the cousin has no more conversation
than Jo he certainly will not bore us with
his chatter," I said. "Now, how about lunch,
Father? We must give Mammy some warning,
because she gets flustrated if we come at her
too suddenly."</p>

<p>"To-morrow suits Jo and his kinsman, and it
will suit us, too, I think. Tell Mammy how many
of us there are and tell her to put up twice as
much lunch as you think she should. That
ought to be 'most enough. We'll want the big
camping coffee pot and a skillet and some salt;
also some sliced bacon, ground coffee and sugar,
and a little flour to roll the rabbits in. We may
make a fire and cook some if we get cold and
have good luck in the morning."</p>

<p>I went out to the kitchen to interview Mammy,
Tweedles following me, and then we had to go
see the dogs. Dee approved of them and they
heartily approved of her. Dum did not have the
passion for them that Dee and I had, but she
liked them well enough. The dogs licked her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
hand respectfully and then jumped up on Dee
and knocked her down and had a big romp.</p>

<p>How delightful it was to have some companions
of my own age at my beloved Bracken!
The Tuckers wanted to see everything and go
everywhere. We visited the horses in the stable
and the cows in the pen and climbed up in the
hay loft to hunt for eggs that a sly old blue hen
refused to lay in the proper place.</p>

<p>"It's just like Grandpa Tucker's, only nicer,"
declared Dum. "Grandpa treats us as though
we were about two years old and treats Zebedee
as though he had just arrived in his teens, so
when we go there, while we have splendid
times, we are being told what not to do from
morning till night."</p>

<p>"Well, nobody ever has told me not to do
things," I said. "Mammy Susan grumbles when
she thinks I am too venturesome, but she has
always ended by letting me have my own way;
and Father says he thinks my way is about as
good as anybody's way."</p>

<p>"Well, isn't it funny you are not spoiled?"
tweedled the girls.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>"I believe I used to be spoiled when I was a
tiny thing; but Father says if people grow up
spoiled, it is because they lack sense, and he always
said he knew I had sense enough to live
down the spoiling that he and Mammy Susan
just couldn't help giving me."</p>

<p>"I believe Dr. Allison is right, Dee," said Dum
very solemnly, "and when we are unruly with
Zebedee I know it is not the fault of our early
training that we love to lay it on, but just plain
lack of sense."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm going to try to be mighty good,
then," exclaimed Dee. "If there is anything in
the world I hate, it's stupidity."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>DEER HUNTING.</div>


<p>It was a glorious morning. Of course we had
to get up before the sun thought of such a thing.
Indeed, there was a crazy, old, lop-sided, dissipated-looking,
gibbous moon still hanging on to
life when we came piling out of the warm, lighted
house and climbed into the two vehicles waiting
for us. Father and Mr. Tucker were to go
in Father's buggy, and the girls and I were very
snug, three on the seat of the runabout, with the
lunch and coffee pot bouncing around in the
back, and the Tuckers' guns carefully stowed
under the seat.</p>

<p>Jo Winn joined us at Milton, the New York
cousin in the buggy with him. We were curious
to see the cousin, whom Father had reported
as being "quite likely." Jo was as good as gold
and perfectly intelligent with a keen sense of
humor, but he was as silent as the tomb. His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
sister Sally was the greatest chatterbox in the
world, I am sure. She simply never stopped
talking except on those occasions when she was
doing her best to "shuffle off this mortal coil,"
and then she seemed to be not able to stop talking
long enough to die thoroughly. Just when
the grave was yawning for her (or maybe because
of her) she would think of something she
simply had to talk about and come back to life.</p>

<p>The Winns were F. F. V.'s, in that they were
among the first families in Virginia, if not of
Virginia. They were not aristocrats, certainly.
They came of good pioneer stock who were tillers
of the soil in the seventeenth century and still
were in the twentieth. They had lived on the
same tract of land for two centuries and a half,
and in America that should stand for aristocracy,
but somehow with the Winns it never had.
They had no desire to be considered great folk
and so they never were. The war between the
states had left them as it had found them, in
fairly prosperous circumstances. Never having
owned slaves, the emancipation of the negroes
did not affect them one way or the other. Having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
always done their own sowing and reaping,
they could still do it. The family had never been
much on marrying, and now there were none
left but the hypochondriacal old maid Sally and
her younger brother Jo.</p>

<p>I had given the twins a history of the Winns
as we spun over to Milton. Pegasus was in fine
feather, which seems a strange thing to say of
a horse, but of one whose name suggests wings,
perhaps it is appropriate.</p>

<p>"I fancy Jo is so silent because Sally talks so
much," suggested Dum.</p>

<p>"Maybe it is the other way and Sally talks so
much to make up for Jo's silence," I said; "but
I hope the cousin from New York will strike a
happy medium."</p>

<p>"A 'cousin from New York' always sounds
so exciting and just as like as not he'll come
from Hoboken. Dr. Allison says he is about
twenty-five, so I reckon he'll not notice us kids,
anyhow. It won't break our hearts, that's sure,"
and Dee tossed her blue-black head in disdain of
all males.</p>

<p>Jo and the cousin were waiting for us at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
crossroads. The cousin was a good-looking
young man with blue eyes and light hair, very
picturesque in a brand new hunting suit, leggins
and all.</p>

<p>"They won't stay new long," I whispered to
the girls, "with Jo's hounds flopping all over
them."</p>

<p>Jo was forced to open his mouth and speak,
as it was up to him to introduce the cousin, but
he did it in as few words as possible.</p>

<p>"Mr. Kent&mdash;Miss Allison." And then an appealing
glance at me gave me to understand that
the matter was in my hands, so I took up the
social burden and introduced Jo and Mr. Kent
to the Tuckers. Mr. Reginald Kent,&mdash;that was
the picturesque name that went with the picturesque
corduroy suit,&mdash;proved himself to be a
young man of resources. He had no idea of
taking the long drive to the spot of the possible
deer alone with the silent Jo, the hounds wallowing
all over his new clothes.</p>

<p>"See here," he exclaimed, "I think one of us
fellows ought to get in with the young ladies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
They might need some protection on the trip."
Jo looked very much amused at my needing protection
and the twins certainly looked buxom
enough to take care of themselves without the
help of Mr. Reginald Kent.</p>

<p>"Well, sort yourselves in a hurry," called
Father. "The colt won't stand another minute
and I don't want to get too far ahead of the
rest of you."</p>

<p>"Let me get in with Mr. Winn," begged Dee.
"I'm crazy to ride with the dogs." Jo's dogs
were the only ones going, although the pack at
Bracken plead piteously to be allowed to join the
party. It seemed best not to take too many, and
Jo's dogs were so well trained that the men had
decided on them.</p>

<p>Mr. Reginald Kent squeezed his new corduroys
between Dum and me, and Dee jumped into
the buggy with the grinning Jo. Dee declared
later that Jo talked as much as most men and
was a very agreeable person; but I fancy the
real truth of the matter was that Dee chattered
away at her usual rate, and that Jo was such an
eloquent listener Dee never did discover that she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
was doing all the talking. Certainly they found
a topic of interest to both of them in the dogs,
and as talking about the dogs meant patting the
dogs, the dogs naturally were pleased.</p>

<p>Our cavalier proved to be very cheerful and
very complimentary. He was evidently much
pleased to escape the silent Jo. We liked him in
spite of his fulsome compliments, and when we
gave him to understand that flattery was not the
way to curry favor with us, he became more natural
and we had a very amusing time with him.
It turned out that he did not live in Hoboken
as Dee had predicted, but in the heart of New
York City. He was employed by an advertising
firm, not only as a writer of advertisements, but
also as illustrator.</p>

<p>"Of course there is no pleasant way of making
a living," he said, "but I long to get out of this
commercial art and into regular illustrating."</p>

<p>"But I adore ads," exclaimed Dum. "Dee and
Zebedee and I always read every word of them
and Zebedee says you can find more pure fiction
in them than in the magazine proper&mdash;or improper."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, after this I shall do my work more enthusiastically
and more conscientiously, knowing
there is a chance of its coming under such eyes,"
and Mr. Kent's glance of admiration into Dum's
hazel eyes gave her to understand he was speaking
of those particular eyes and not Dee's and
Zebedee's. I rather expected to see Dum give him
a back-hander, but instead she blushed in rather
a pleased way, just as any young girl should
on receiving such a compliment from a handsome
young man from New York.</p>

<p>The roads in our county are much improved,
thanks to the automobilists who have worked
such reforms throughout the whole country. On
that morning they were hard and dry, even
dusty, and we went spinning along through the
frosty air, Father ahead with the colt behaving
as though it were a hurry call and every moment
counted. I was next in line and Peg was
giving me all I could do to hold her in. She
seemed to want to let us all see that an upstartish
colt could trot no faster than she could.
I was rather glad that Mr. Reginald Kent had
taken a fancy to hazel eyes instead of gray, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
I needed my gray eyes to pick a smooth road for
Peg. Jo Winn and Dee were just far enough
behind us to keep out of our dust, and occasionally
we could hear Dee's ringing laugh and an
unusual guffaw from the silent Jo.</p>

<p>"You see now why we couldn't come in your
automobile, as Mr. Tucker wanted," I said to
Dum, as Father wheeled the colt sharply to the
left into a forest of pines where scrub oaks and
chinquepins almost concealed a very poor excuse
for a road.</p>

<p>"Come on, Daughter," Father called back to
me; "we'll keep close together through the
woods, as there is no dust."</p>

<p>I really believe that the road through that
pine forest is the very worst road in Virginia,
and that is saying a good deal, as my beloved
state has only recently awakened to the fact that
it reflects on her standing to be noted as having
the worst roads in the Union. That particular
road had great granite bowlders; ruts that
threatened to swallow us; gnarled tree roots that
stretched across the path as though they meant
to trip us up; and sometimes even a fallen trunk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
over which we would have to bounce, testing the
springs of our vehicles to their utmost endurance.</p>

<p>"Well, I reckon little Henry Ford" (that is
what the Tuckers called their car), "would have
been ditched long before this," gasped Dum, as
one wheel took a bowlder and the other a deep
rut.</p>

<p>"Miss Allison, I haven't asked you to let me
assist you in driving, just because I know you
can do it so much better than I can," said Mr.
Kent. "I'd have turned over there as sure as
I'm born."</p>

<p>"Well, I came mighty near doing it," I
laughed. "If Dum's hat had not been on the
side and tilted toward the bowlder, we would
have landed in the ditch, I know. We had just
about an ounce's weight in our favor."</p>

<p>"I guess it's a good thing I part my hair in
the middle in these hairbreadth escapes. Just
think, suppose it had been parted on the left side
and had counterbalanced Miss Dum's hat tipped
toward the right! Over we would have gone."</p>

<p>Just then a Molly Cotton-tail jumped up out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
of the bracken and the dogs set up a fearful
howling. It was all Jo Winn and Dee could do
to hold them in their places. Mr. Tucker and
Dum looked longingly at their guns but the colt
would not stand for shooting going on so close
to him, and, besides, when people go out for
deer they do not want to begin on rabbits. So
little Miss Molly got off for that time at least.</p>

<p>I was glad. There is something in my make-up
that recoils from killing anything. To be
sure, I am fond of a rabbit's hind leg, about as
good eating as one can find, but when I am picking
on one of those hind legs I have to close my
mind carefully to the fact that that same hind
leg has helped to carry some Bre'r Rabbit
through many a briar patch. If the image comes
to me of a perky little white tail scurrying
through the bushes with the eager dogs in pursuit,
I simply have to give up eating the delectable
morsel and Mammy Susan has to broil me
some bacon.</p>

<p>"Hi, there, Uncle Peter," called Father to an
old negro man approaching on a mule, a great
sack of corn balanced on his pommel, "don't tell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
me you are not at home when we are coming to
see you."</p>

<p>"Well, Docallison, I done tech bottom in de
meal bag dis very mawnin', an' I was jes' a takin'
some cawn to de mill; but efn de quality folks
is a comin' ter see me, I kin sho make out wif
de scrapin's till anudder day."</p>

<p>"We are going to try our luck with the deer,
Uncle Peter, and I thought we would leave our
teams at your cabin and get you to bring our
provisions over to Falling Water in your wheelbarrow."</p>

<p>"'Visions, you say? Well, efn you's goin' ter
have 'visions, dey ain't no us'n my goin' ter de
mill fer days ter come. 'Visions from Bracken
means dat Mammy Susan done had her say-so,
and dat ole nigger 'oman is sho a amplified perfider.
They'll be 'nuf leavins ter feed de multitude
on Mount Aryrat." And Uncle Peter
turned his willing mule's head around and led
the way to his cabin.</p>

<p>Click! Click! went Mr. Kent's pocket camera.
"Exactly the type I am looking for! Now, Miss
Dum, when you look through the advertisements<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
several months from now, be sure to notice a
certain molasses that is to be put on the market.
Uncle Peter will be there taking his corn to the
mill so he can have a 'pone to sop in de 'lasses.'
Oh, look at the cabin! Isn't it charming?"</p>

<p>It was indeed a typical log cabin. It was old,
very old, but Uncle Peter kept it in good repair,
patching the mortar in the chinks from time to
time and propping up the great stone chimney
that stood at about the angle of the Leaning
Tower of Pisa. On the door and walls were
tacked many coon skins. That is the method employed
for curing the skins, and Uncle Peter
made quite a little money selling coon skins. He
had only a small clearing around his cabin but
a good cornfield down in the creek bottom.</p>

<p>"'Light, 'light," said Uncle Peter, "Rosana
will be that proud ter 'ceive you. She been
throwing rocks all mornin' at that ole Shanghai
rooster who would crow fer comp'ny. Co'se
Rosana didn't know de comp'ny was a goin' ter
be white folks. She done' low it would be some
er dem low-down niggers tother side er de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
swamp what is always a-comin' empty and gwine
away full."</p>

<p>Aunt Rosana squeezed herself sideways
through the cabin door. She was a mountain
of flesh, with about as much shape as a football.
Indeed, she looked very like the potato
babies Mammy Susan used to make me: a big
potato for the body; a little potato for a head,
stuck on with a match; feet and arms of peanuts;
and a face scratched on with a kitchen
fork. Her voice sounded like hot mashed potato
as she bade us welcome.</p>

<p>"Well, efn I won't hab ter gib dat ole Shanghai
rooster a extry handful er wheat! Here I
been a-was'in' time all mornin' tryin' ter make
him shet up his 'nostigatin' fer comp'ny, not
thinkin' he was a-crowin' fer quality. I mought
a-knowed he wouldn't er crowed so loud an' clear
fer nuthin' but niggers, an' swamp niggers, at
dat," and a laugh shook her huge body, reminding
me of the "bowl full of jelly."</p>

<p>We were glad to stretch ourselves after the
long drive, and Aunt Rosana took us into her
cabin while the men of the party attended to unhitching<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
the horses. The cabin was spotless, although
the one room it boasted was kitchen, parlor
and bedroom in one. A great fireplace almost
the entire length of one side of the room
was really the kitchen. Aunt Rosana scorned
iron stoves and still did her cooking with pot-hooks
and Dutch ovens. Even now, hanging
from one hook, was a singing black iron kettle
and from another a covered pot from which issued
an aroma that told me that Uncle Peter was
going to have cabbage for dinner. Homemade
rag rugs covered the floor almost entirely, but
wherever a spot of oak flooring showed, it was
gleaming white with much scrubbing.</p>

<p>A great four-poster had the place of honor opposite
the fireplace. It was a bed fit for the
slumbers of kings and princes. Many families
in Virginia will exhibit just such beds and
proudly tell you that in those beds Lafayette and
Washington had slept. I don't know how Uncle
Peter and Aunt Rosana happened to have it, but
I know that the beautiful old bed had never harbored
a more worthy couple. The patchwork
quilt, with its intricate rising-sun pattern, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Aunt Rosana's handiwork. The walls were decorated
with brilliant chromos, calendars dating
back into the 'seventies and on up to date.</p>

<p>The twins were charmed with the place and
their interest was most flattering to Aunt Rosana.
She showed them all her treasures, even
her photograph album.</p>

<p>"And who are all of these people?" asked
Dum, who was politely looking at every photograph.</p>

<p>"Lor', chile, I dunno. Peter bought dat ere
album at a sale ober in de nex' county. Ev'ybody
in de book is white, an' dey looks like quality
ter me; but dese days yer can't tell. Some
er de quality is lookin' moughty stringy an' de
oberseer class is pickin' up so dey is kinder mergin'
inter great folks."</p>

<p>"What's this up your chimney?" queried Dee,
peering up the great flue.</p>

<p>"Oh, dat's whar I smokes my meat. They's
some shoulders up dar; an' some sides er baking
wif a streak er fat an' a streak er lean as pretty
as any you kin buy in de city. An' them's my
little chany valuebowles what I been collecking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
of sence I was a baby," said Aunt Rosana to
Dum, who was examining a great array of little
china ornaments on top of a large old highboy.</p>

<p>There were little china girls kissing little china
boys; little baskets with turtle doves on the handles;
pink puppies and green cats, some of them
meant for match safes and some of them purely
ornamental; little cups and saucers of every
shape and hue; little pitchers with big ears and
some with no ears at all. I have never been in
a cabin of self-respecting colored people where
there was not a chest of drawers or a table filled
with similar treasures. I know Aunt Rosana
thought as much of her "chany valuebowles" as
Father did of his books, and her sensations when
Dum almost dropped a little shell-covered box
was just what Father's would have been if he
had seen a careless reader turn down a page in
one of his beloved books, or bend back the covers
of one of his first editions.</p>

<p>"Do look at this," begged Dum of Mr. Kent,
who had just entered the cabin. She held up
in her hand a china cow of a decidedly lavender
hue with horns and hoofs of gilt, and quoted:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
"'I never saw a purple cow;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I never hope to see one;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But I can tell you, anyhow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I'd rather see than be one.'"</span><br />
<br />
"'Ah, yes, I wrote the "Purple Cow"&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I'm sorry now I wrote it!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But I can tell you, anyhow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I'll kill you if you quote it!'"</span><br />
</div>

<div class="uninident">laughed Mr. Kent, taking the fearful and wonderful
animal in his hands and examining it with
great interest. "Isn't this place delightful? If
I had only brought my sketching things instead
of my gun, I'd stay here and paint. I'm going
to ask Aunt Rosana to let me take some time
exposures of the interior of her cabin. Just look
at that bed and that fireplace! Thank goodness,
I've got my camera with a perfectly new
film good for twelve exposures."</div>

<p>"Well, Gawd be praised dat ole Shanghai gib
me warnin' of comp'ny comin' an' I done stirred
my stumps an' straightened up some, efn my
room's goin' ter git its Dager'type took," and
Aunt Rosana's flesh quivered with delight.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE MIGHTY HUNTER.</div>


<p>The pictures were soon taken and we were on
our way to the low country. Everyone carried
a gun but me. Uncle Peter brought up the rear
with a wheelbarrow laden with the "'visions."</p>

<p>It was a long walk but such a delightful one
that we never once thought of getting tired.
Our way lay through a pine forest and was up
hill and down dale. Tweedles and I were as
well able to take the walk as any of the male
persuasion, although it took some time to make
Mr. Kent understand that we could get along
without his assistance. He would help Dum
over a worm fence, much to Dee's and my
amusement, as we knew that Dum could vault it
with one hand, just as we did.</p>

<p>"I never saw such independent young ladies as
you three," he confessed after a daring leap we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
had made over a gulch. "The girls I know in
New York expect to be assisted over every gutter."</p>

<p>"Maybe that's their town manner, and if they
were turned loose in the country they might help
themselves as well as we can," I suggested. "To
tell the truth, it makes me fall down if anyone
helps me."</p>

<p>"Do you know," whispered Dee to me, "I verily
believe that Reginald Kent person is getting
stuck on Dum? I hope he won't shoot her. I
don't believe he ever carried a gun before in his
life. He handles it like a walking stick."</p>

<p>"He's real nice, don't you think?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, nice enough, but I can't see why
Dum lets him boost her over every stick and
stone. She's perfectly able-bodied. She looks
to me as though she rather liked to be treated
like a boneless vertebrate," and Dee looked very
disgusted. The fact was that Dum was taking
the helping just as she was taking the compliments:
in a perfectly natural, girlish way.</p>

<p>"Fond of the country?" asked Mr. Tucker,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
glancing with an amused twinkle at Mr. Kent's
nonchalant manner of holding his gun.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, fond enough, what I know of it.
I've had to stick pretty close to Broadway all
my life. I spent a summer down here with the
Winns once when I was a kid and that's about
the only country I've known."</p>

<p>"Haven't you hunted before?" questioned
Dum, jumping back from the barrel of Mr.
Kent's new gun that was pointing ominously at
her.</p>

<p>"Well, I've shot the 'shoots' at Coney Island,
and have practiced at hitting the bull's-eye in the
galleries at that gay resort until I can ring the
bell every time, but that is the extent of my experience,"
and Mr. Kent looked a little wistful.
"I'd be mighty glad of some pointers from any
of you that have had more."</p>

<p>"Well, point your gun, barrel down," tweedled
the twins.</p>

<p>"Ah, so, I see," he said, grasping his gun in
a more sportsmanlike manner, and all of us
breathed a sigh of relief. I had been in terror
for fear he might ring a b-e-l-l-e or hit some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
eye not in a bull ever since we left Aunt Rosana's
cabin. "I'm awfully green," continued
the young man, modestly. "I cut a poorer figure
turned loose here in the country than old Uncle
Peter would on the Great White Way."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," said Mr. Tucker kindly. He
seemed rather impressed by Mr. Kent's frankness
and modesty. Indeed, the young New
Yorker could not cut a poor figure anywhere.
He was well grown and sturdy and had an athletic
swing to his walk due not only to much
work in a gymnasium but to the "magnificent
distances" he had been compelled to walk in
New York.</p>

<p>I have noticed that town-bred persons as a
rule walk much better than country-bred. When
they get on rough ground they walk as though
it were smooth, while country people when they
strike pavements look as though they were still
getting over plowed ground. Reginald Kent, if
he did not know how to carry a gun, knew how
to carry himself. With shoulders back, chin in
and head well up, he stepped along like a West<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
Pointer; while Jo Winn slouched with shoulders
bent and head forward.</p>

<p>We chatted away very merrily until we came
to the creek where the party was to separate.
There was not much chance of any game, big or
little, with such a crowd tramping through the
woods. It was agreed that Father, Mr. Tucker
and Jo Winn should cross the creek and go on
to the river, where they were to take a skiff,
owned by old Uncle Peter and kept moored at
a certain spot, known to Father; from there they
were to go into the marshes; and, later on, come
down the river and join us at the mouth of the
creek. We were to keep on straight down the
creek with Uncle Peter and Mr. Kent, who earnestly
desired to stay and "take care" of the
ladies.</p>

<p>"I'm going to change my loads for rabbits,"
said Dee, suiting the action to the word. "This
big shot would tear a rabbit all to pieces and I
believe we are more apt to see rabbits than
deer."</p>

<p>Mr. Kent followed suit but Dum kept "loaded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
fur b'ar," as she expressed it. Dee soon got a
rabbit, which she wept over.</p>

<p>"She always does that," explained Dum. "She
shoots things for the love of shooting and then
bawls because she has taken an innocent life."</p>

<p>We had one of Jo's dogs with us. The other
two had gone with the three men to stalk the
possible deer. Our dog started up several rabbits
and Mr. Kent joyously got two of them.</p>

<p>"Gee, this beats clay pigeons and shooting galleries,"
he declared. "I feel like a man-eating
lion now; since I have tasted blood, I'll never be
content to go back to my quiet, uneventful life."</p>

<p>We pitched camp near the mouth of the creek
on a cliff overlooking the river. Uncle Peter
and I made a fire and skinned the rabbits, while
the Tuckers and the cavalier went off in search
of more game. Under a great ledge of rock
we found some snow left from a storm we had
before Christmas, and after washing the rabbits
well and letting them stand in cold water
long enough to get out the animal heat, we
buried them in the snow: "Ter git the fraishness
out'n em," explained Uncle Peter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>I always loved to mess around a campfire, and
Uncle Peter proved a most delightful companion.</p>

<p>"I like this a lot better than killing things,
Uncle Peter," I said.</p>

<p>"Sho, child, so do I. I've been a-huntin' all
my life, but it ain't been fer pleasure. I hunts
fer a livin' an' I wouldn't shoot nothin' fer the
love er killin' any mor'n I'd go dig taters fer
exercise. I digs taters fer taters. I done tuck
de libbuty of bringin' some sweet taters I made
dis year fer ter roas' fer you-alls dinner," and
the old man pulled a bag from the wheelbarrow
that held great sweet potatoes almost as big as
my head.</p>

<p>"They's nothin' so 'lectable as sweet taters
what is roasted in de cam'fire. Jes' put 'em down
in de ashes and kiver 'em over an' den fergit
'em, jes' fergit 'em. Dey can't cook too long
'kase de mo' de outside burns de mealier de inside
is go'nter git," and Uncle Peter piled on
more brushwood and raked the hot ashes over
the yams.</p>

<p>Every now and then we heard a shot off in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the direction of the Amazons and their so-called
protector. I did hope the girls were having good
luck and would come back with game of some
sort. Uncle Peter and I got out the "'visions"
and began to prepare for the hunters who, experience
told us, would come along soon, hungry
as wolves.</p>

<p>"Killin's a mighty ap'tizin' spo't," laughed
Uncle Peter, "an' victuals cooked in de open
seems ter be mo' tasty-like dan de ones in kitchens."</p>

<p>First we fried the bacon and then put it in a
covered pan to keep hot, and used the bacon
grease to fry the rabbits, which we had seasoned
very highly and rolled in flour. I filled the coffee
pot with fresh water from a bubbling spring
near by, and, resting it on two stones about six
inches apart, I raked out hot coals, and soon it
began to heat up. I had just completed this
culinary feat when Uncle Peter whispered to
me:</p>

<p>"Look, chile, down yander by the ribber!"</p>

<p>The cliff where we had pitched our little camp
overlooked the river, and about a hundred yards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
from the base of our cliff was a graveled ford, or
shallows. The scrub growth was close down to
the water's edge but stretching out into the
stream was a little sandy beach. Beyond the
scrub growth rose the dark pines, and an occasional
oak with its great bare branches towered
above all meaner trees. From the underbrush
had stepped a young buck. He was picking his
way daintily across the pebbles to the water's
edge. How beautiful he was! I wanted our
guests to have good sport, but I longed with a
longing that was almost a prayer that no one
with a gun was seeing what Uncle Peter and I
were seeing. What wind there was came from
his direction so he got no scent of us, and he
drank his fill with unconcern, as though he lived
in the "forest primeval." Then he proudly
raised his antlered head and stood a moment
sniffing the air.</p>

<p>"Bang!" rang out a shot, whizzing close to my
ear, and "Bang!" came the echo from the cliff.
The young buck stood a moment as though
sculptured, and not until the echo answered did
he drop. It almost seemed that the echo had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
been the good shot that had laid low this possible
future leader of herds.</p>

<p>"Oh, the pity of it! The pity of it!" my heart
cried out. Turning, I saw my friends on a ledge
of rock farther down the river; Dum, with her
smoking gun still raised to her shoulder, an
exalted look on her face and her black hair with
the coppery lights tumbling all about her, an
Amazon, indeed; Dee, crumpled up in a little
heap, her hands over her face.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" shouted Reginald Kent, beside
himself with excitement.</p>

<p>Dee jumped up from her crumpled heap and
clambered down the cliff, tears streaming down
her face and great sobs shaking her body. She
fortunately had on waterproof boots, because
she thought no more of water than she did of
land. She splashed right across the shallow
ford and, kneeling down by the poor deer, she
buried her tear-stained face on his twitching
shoulder.</p>

<p>Just then the skiff with Mr. Tucker, Father
and Jo Winn came round a bend in the river.</p>

<p>"Hello! What's this?" called Mr. Tucker in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
some alarm, seeing his daughter kneeling on
the sand by an expiring stag. "Where's Dum?
What's happened?"</p>

<p>"It's just Dee, deedling," called out Dum. "I
shot the deer and now Dee's breaking her heart."</p>

<p>"O&mdash;h, O&mdash;h, but he recognized me just before
he died!" sobbed Dee. "I could tell by the
way he looked at me."</p>

<p>"It was a good thing he did 'recognize' you,"
grinned Jo Winn. "If he had not, he might
have gored you. An injured buck is a right dangerous
thing to fool with."</p>

<p>We comforted Dee as best we could and
praised Dum for her shot. Soon we were gathered
around our campfire, and then Uncle Peter
and I came in for our share of praise for the
good dinner we had cooked.</p>

<p>"We'll feast on venison to-morrow," said
Father.</p>

<p>"Ah, never!" shuddered Dee. "I couldn't, not
after he recognized me."</p>

<p>"Maybe Molly Cottontail, whose hind leg you
seem to be enjoying so, would have recognized
you, too, if she had ever seen you before," teased<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
Mr. Tucker. "Now, Miss Page, here, has such
a tender heart she can't eat rabbit that she has
seen running in the woods but contents herself
with bacon."</p>

<p>"Have you no pity, then, for the poor faithful
hogs?" asked Father. "They no doubt enjoy
life as much as the deer or Bre'r Rabbit. That
is perhaps bacon from one of old Sally's offspring;
and, Page, you used to play with those
pigs when they were little as though they were
kittens. I have no doubt all of the litter would
recognize you. When we begin to sentimentalize
about our food, we had better 'open our mouths
and shut our eyes,' as there is no telling to what
lengths it may lead us."</p>

<p>"But, Doctor, you know 'Pigs is pigs,'" broke
in Mr. Tucker, and the discussion ended with a
laugh.</p>

<p>After dinner the gentlemen made another excursion
across the river but came back without
having seen even a deer track. They got a few
partridges, however, and some rabbits and were
content. We started home through the pine forest
a very happy, merry party.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Reginald Kent stuck closer than a brother
to Dum's side, and Mr. Tucker, who was walking
with me, and I overheard this conversation
between the infatuated young New Yorker and
the ingenuous Dum:</p>

<p>"Do you know, Miss Dum, you looked like
Diana when you stood on that rock and aimed
at the deer? I wanted to paint you awfully
bad and did click the camera on you. I hope
you don't mind."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I don't mind if it will help you any
in your advertising. Are you going to put me
in the 'lasses ad, too?"</p>

<p>"Oh, now, Miss Dum, quit your kidding! You
know I didn't mean I wanted to paint you for
advertising, I meant for myself." And then
Dum blushed.</p>

<p>Mr. Tucker frowned. He evidently did not
relish his girls getting old enough to be talked
to that way.</p>

<p>"Miss Dum, will you do me a great favor?"
continued Mr. Kent. "I want more than anything
in the world a lock of your hair. It is the
most wonderful hair I have ever seen. Sometimes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
it looks black, and then in another light it
is almost red. When it came down while you
were aiming at the deer, it was like copper in
the sun. Please give me just a little lock to take
back to New York with me."</p>

<p>"I am afraid Zebedee would not like for me
to cut my hair," answered Dum primly. "But I
tell you," she added generously, "I can save you
the combings, if you would like them."</p>

<p>Mr. Reginald Kent looked rather nonplused
and Mr. Tucker handed me his gun to hold while
he rolled in the leaves for very joy. As we were
bringing up the rear, nobody saw this pantomime
but me, and I was as glad as Dum's father that
she was not going to be grown up for a while
yet.</p>

<p>Mr. Kent was to go back to New York on the
following day; in a little more than a week Dum
would be in boarding school; and it would of
necessity be many a day before the two could
meet again. Perhaps the next time they do
meet, Dum will have grown to the age when she
will know that to offer a young man combings in
lieu of a lock is not conducive to romance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A VISIT TO RICHMOND.</div>


<p>Those were certainly three mad, merry days
I spent in Richmond with the Tuckers. Poor
Father had to go to Cousin Park Garnett's and
he just hated it. But he had promised her that
the first time he went to Richmond he would stay
at her house, and stay he had to.</p>

<p>The Tuckers met us at the station in little
Henry Ford. It had been only a few days since
they had been with us at Bracken, but we had
much to talk about and a great deal of news to
exchange.</p>

<p>"Father is having the deer skin tanned to
make a rug for our room at Gresham, and the
antlers are to be mounted for a hat-rack," exclaimed
Dum.</p>

<p>"Sally Winn tried to die last night, and I
drove over to Milton with Father, and Jo told<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
me he thought you, Dee, were the most sensible
lady he had ever met," I managed to get in.</p>

<p>"He promised me a pointer pup; I hope he
won't forget it. Brindle had a fight yesterday
and is all bunged up from it. I know you are
dying to meet Brindle," said Dee.</p>

<p>"No doubt she is pining away for that honor,"
teased Mr. Tucker, "but don't you think she
could wait until after luncheon? How about it,
Miss Page?"</p>

<p>"Well, if Brindle can stand it, I fancy I can,"
said I. And so we went to a delightful restaurant,
where we had a scrumptious luncheon (I
know no other word to express it): Lynhaven
oysters on the deep shell; Hampton spots so
beautifully cooked that it must have made them
glad to be caught and fried; shoestring potatoes
vying with the fish in charm; Waldorf
salad, with everything in it but the kitchen stove,
as Dee declared.</p>

<p>Cousin Park was not expecting Father until
the afternoon, so he was spared to us for a little
while, much to his delight and ours.</p>

<p>"Now, what shall we have for dessert?" asked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
our genial host. "Tweedles always wants pie,&mdash;cocoanut,
as a rule."</p>

<p>"Pink ice cream for me," said Father. "Did
you ever see a country Jake that didn't want pink
ice cream as soon as he hit the city?"</p>

<p>"What seasoning?" laughed Mr. Tucker.</p>

<p>"I don't care, just so it's pink."</p>

<p>"I believe I'll have what Father has. I like it
pink, too."</p>

<p>"Well, cocoanut pie for mine," ordered Dum.</p>

<p>"And lemon meringue for mine," ordered Dee.</p>

<p>"You are not like the young man who never
ate lemon meringue pie because it messed up his
ears so, are you, Dee?" said Mr. Tucker; and
so our gay little luncheon proceeded.</p>

<p>"My, how I hate to go to Cousin Park's!"
sighed Father. "She is kind in a way, but so&mdash;so&mdash;ponderous."</p>

<p>"Poor Father!" and I patted his knee under
the table, "I do wish you didn't have to go."</p>

<p>"Well, I have plenty of engagements that will
keep me busy, and I won't have to do much more
than eat and sleep there. But it is her long formal
dinners that bore me so."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, you have simply got to have dinner
with us to-morrow, Saturday, evening at the
Country Club, and no doubt these girls will have
you fox-trotting before the evening is over,"
and Mr. Tucker would not take "No" for an answer,&mdash;not
that Father was very persistent in
his refusal. We dropped the dear man at Cousin
Park's great, dark house and he had the look of
"Give up all hope ye who enter here."</p>

<p>The Tuckers had a very attractive apartment
in a large, new, up-to-date building, but I could
fancy the havoc that Dum and Dee caused whenever
they resorted to the gloves to settle their
disputes. The place was so full of nicknacks
that one could hardly turn around. There were
really enough of what Mammy Susan called
"doodads" to decorate a mansion, and all of
these things were crowded into a not very large
apartment. Some of the things were very beautiful
and all of them were interesting, but if they
belonged to me I would pack about half of them
away in storage.</p>

<p>I thought of a colored woman in the country
who lived in a very small cabin with six little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
children falling over her feet all the time, and
she used to pray fervently, "Oh, Gawd, gimme
grace not ter git so pestered dat I'll throw ary
one er dem out do's." I am afraid I would have
been so pestered with all of the doodads that I
would surely have thrown some of them outdoors.</p>

<p>"Miss Page, I have been trying to persuade
Tweedles to help me to get rid of some of the
mess in these rooms," said Mr. Tucker, almost
as though he had read my mind. "I feel the
stuffiness of it even more since our visit at
Bracken." That was it, the simplicity of Bracken
had spoiled me for overcrowded rooms.</p>

<p>"But Zebedee, everything we want to get rid
of is just the thing you think most of, and the
things that you think superfluous are our special
treasures," complained Dum.</p>

<p>"Well, I am afraid we'll have to wait until you
get some kind of education, and then, if stocks
is riz, we'll move into a house big enough to
spread out in."</p>

<p>Their rugs were beautiful and their pictures
I have since found out were very fine. At that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
time, however, they did not seem very good to
me. The taste in art of a fifteen-year-old girl
who has seen next to no pictures is not to be
relied upon; and no doubt my taste was abominable.</p>

<p>Brindle took me to his heart and made me perfectly
at home. He was a bow-legged, brindle
bull with undershot jaw and eyes like damson
jam. Dee loved him next to Zebedee and Dum;
and I know cried herself to sleep many a night
at boarding school, longing for her pet. He was
certainly a very human person, or rather dog, I
should say, and ruled the Tuckers with a rod of
iron. He actually made Mr. Tucker get out of
a chair that he, Brindle, had taken a fancy to,
and he curled himself up on the seat with a
haughty sniff that made us scream with laughter,
until Dee insisted that we control our merriment,
as Brindle did not like to be laughed at.</p>

<p>"It is his one fault," she said; "he has not a
very keen sense of humor."</p>

<p>"He has one other, Dee," said Mr. Tucker;
"he does smell like a dog, you must admit." Dee
had to admit it, but declared she thought a dog<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
should smell like a dog and not like a tuberose;
so the discussion ended.</p>

<p>We took in the movies that afternoon. I don't
know how many of them, but it was great fun.</p>

<p>"Zebedee won't usually let us go without him,"
said Dee, "but he thinks you are dignified enough
to hold us down."</p>

<p>"Me&mdash;dignified? Why, father thinks I am as
wild as a March hare!"</p>

<p>"Well, Zebedee says you know when to be
quiet. Zebedee likes you a lot, Page," declared
Dum. "If you weren't exactly what you are,
Dee and I would be awfully jealous of you.
What you blushing about?" Such a double-barreled
compliment would make an old pair of
leather saddle bags blush; and a girl of my thin
skin naturally took on a rosy hue, that Dee declared
put me out of the chaperone class.</p>

<p>That evening we went to a vaudeville performance.
Mr. Tucker's newspaper connection
gave him the <i>entr&eacute;e</i> anywhere in the house, so
we were very grand in box seats. A particularly
amusing black-faced artist was giving a song-and-dance
when Dee exclaimed:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look up there in the balcony!" And what
should we see but Father's dear old lean, solemn
face convulsed with merriment. Zebedee&mdash;I
mean Mr. Tucker&mdash;went up and made him join
us.</p>

<p>"How did you escape Cousin Park?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, she thinks I am in solemn conclave with
some of my professional brethren! I didn't exactly
tell a lie, but I acted one. It was either
that or burst a blood vessel. You know my
Cousin Park, do you not, Mr. Tucker?"</p>

<p>"Y-e-s, I know her, but she never seems to
know me. With Mrs. Garnett, one must have
either plenty of very blue blood or more than
plenty of very yellow gold. I've got blue blood
to burn, but no yellow gold, as you know. There
must be something radically wrong with me in
her eyes. What it is, I don't know; nor do I
much care. I was very fond of her husband.
Major Peyton Garnett was a good friend to me.
I admired him immensely."</p>

<p>"Yes, the Major was a fine old gentleman,"
said father. He afterward told me that one reason
he had to escape from Cousin Park's presence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
or break a blood vessel was that she had so
many unkind things to say of Mr. Jeffry Tucker,
the old croaker that she was! "I am sorry for
you, Page, but you are in for a Sunday dinner at
Cousin Park's." I groaned in agonized anticipation.
"I couldn't get out of it for you, my
child, she made such a point of it. She is our
kinswoman, and we have to show her some respect."</p>

<p>"Well, thank goodness, this time I don't have
to go to the dentist's, too! The combination of
Cousin Park and the dentist is a strong one, I
can tell you. If you can stand her, Father, I
reckon I can."</p>

<p>"That's my good girl," said Father, patting my
shoulder, and Mr. Tucker gave me a warm and
friendly glance and said:</p>

<p>"Tweedles and I will see that you get there
late and come away early."</p>

<p>It seems to me I laughed more at that vaudeville
performance than anybody in the theater.
I had seen very few shows in my life, and everything
was new and fresh to me. I was not bored
even by the strong man who seemed to be so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
tiresome to the audience, and no joke was too
much of a chestnut to be scorned by me. To
have Father with us, too, made my cup of happiness
full to the brim.</p>

<p>The next evening, Saturday, we had dinner at
the Country Club, and stayed for the dance afterward.
The Country Club was a beautiful
building with spacious grounds, golf links, tennis
courts, and a view of the James River that
appealed to me very much. The dinner was fine,
and Father and I had a splendid time.</p>

<p>"I am glad to escape all the meals I can at the
apartment house caf&eacute;," confessed Mr. Tucker.
"When Tweedles are away, I eat anywhere but
at home."</p>

<p>"You are an extravagant piece," said Dee.</p>

<p>"But I have my regular meals served for
Brindle," laughed Mr. Tucker.</p>

<p>"Oh, that alters the case, then!" exclaimed
Dee. "Brindle should have just as good food as
people, with a variety of vegetables."</p>

<p>What a ballroom floor they had at that clubhouse!
I had never danced, as I said before,
until I went to school, but I had been an apt pupil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
because I was such an eager one, and now
knew enough of the modern dances to get along
very well. I had never in my life danced with a
man. At school we took turns guiding, and I
was much sought after because of my being so
untiring.</p>

<p>"Miss Page, you are the guest of honor and I
am the host, so it is in order that you give me
this first dance." And Mr. Jeffry Tucker bowed
in front of me as though I were a great society
belle.</p>

<p>The Tuckers were all born dancers, and as I
glided away with Mr. Tucker, I remembered
what Miss Jane Cox had said about his leading
the germans at the University with his little
sweetheart Virginia, afterward his wife. A
great wave of pity for the poor little dead wife
swept over me, and I came very near missing
step in a rather intricate dance we were attempting.
It must have been so sad to die and leave
such a delightful husband and the twins, who
were such charming girls that they must have
been cunning little babies. What a vigorous
presence was Jeffry Tucker's! He must have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
been a lover that any girl would have been happy
with. I hoped if I ever did have a lover that he
would be the kind that I fancied Mr. Tucker
must have been. Something made me blush as
my thoughts dwelt on my ever having a lover.</p>

<p>"My, what a color dancing gives you!" exclaimed
my partner. "A minute ago you looked
so sad I wondered what you were thinking of,
and now you are as rosy as the dawn."</p>

<p>"'It is darkest just before dawn,' you know,"
I answered. I wondered what he would have
said had he known what I was thinking of when
I looked so sad. And then a strange thing happened,
and the kind of thing has happened very
often in my life when I have been with Mr.
Tucker: he took up my thoughts almost as
though he had read them and said:</p>

<p>"I was thinking of my little girl wife, Virginia.
I so often think of her when I dance.
She and I danced our youth away. She was a
wonderful dancer. She had the same smooth
glide that you have. I hate a hoppy dancer,"
and with his usual disregard of appearances he
wiped his eyes in which the big tears had gathered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
I did feel so sorry for him, I actually had
the hardihood to pat him on the shoulder where
my left hand rested, but I could not say anything
to him, I felt so choky. The sun came out in a
very few moments, however, and he smiled into
my eyes, and we finished the dance without ever
losing a step. I know Mr. Jeffry Tucker is the
only person in the world who could cry and dance
at the same time. His tears were sincere, too,
quite as sincere as his dancing, and he certainly
put his whole soul into every step he took.</p>

<p>"Miss Page, you have been mighty good to
Tweedles. I don't know how to thank you for
it," he said, as the music stopped and left us
stranded across the ballroom from Father and
the twins, also, who had been dancing with some
college boys, home for the holidays.</p>

<p>"Me good to them! Why, they are good to
me, as good as gold!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know what you have done for them.
They control themselves so much better than
they used to and are so much more considerate
in every way. I see your influence at every turn.
They haven't had a fight since they came home<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
and actually listen when I talk, whether I have
anything to say or not." I had to laugh at this.
I had really made the girls come to their senses
about fighting when they disagreed. Even with
gloves on, it was a very boisterous way of settling
disputes; and we had a rule at 117 Carter
Hall, instituted by me, that a fine of one penny
was imposed when any of us interrupted, unless
the speaker had had the floor out of all reason.</p>

<p>We found the girls enthusiastic over the dancing,
and Father having as good a time as any of
us. It was his first experience in seeing the
much written and talked-of new dances, and he
was greatly interested.</p>

<p>"Why, daughter, you dance beautifully!" he
said fondly, as I squeezed in by him. "If you
have learned as much Latin and French at Gresham
as you have dancing, you will be a highly-educated
young woman."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't promise that," I laughed; "but I
know how to conjugate 'to dance' both in Latin
and French."</p>

<p>"Well, to be able to conjugate as well as dance
means you are becoming very erudite. That is a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
very pretty step that Dum has been taking. Is
that the fox-trot? It looks easy, too."</p>

<p>"It is easy, Doctor Allison," answered Dum,
"and now they are going to dance it again. Come
on and try!" And to the delight and astonishment
of all of us, Father was on the floor with
Dum fox-trotting with a precision that made us
know he had been watching the dancers very
carefully and had been mentally dancing for
some time. I know he had not danced for at least
sixteen years, but, like Miss Jane Cox, once a
dancer, always a dancer.</p>

<p>"This is more fun than Gresham," whispered
Dee to me, when we stopped to rest a minute
between dances. The college students had been
very attentive and the twins and I had danced
every dance. Who should come rushing up to
us at this moment but Mabel Binks! She embraced
us noisily, and one would have thought we
were her long-lost sisters. We were coldly polite,
but she overlooked our want of cordiality
and fastened herself on to us. There was nothing
for us but to introduce her to Father and
Mr. Tucker and the young men who had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
dancing attendance on us. That was what she
wanted, and the dead set she made at Mr. Tucker
showed what she considered big game. The festive
Mabel, who lived in Newport News, was
stopping in Richmond for a few days on her way
back to Gresham. She was visiting an old cousin
who, she volubly explained, was too selfish to
do anything for her pleasure. She had with
difficulty persuaded her to bring her to the Country
Club, and now they were there the cousin
either wouldn't or couldn't introduce her to any
men.</p>

<p>"I can just shift for myself, I'll let her know!"
the dashing girl exclaimed. "The wall is not
meant for me to hold up, and if no one will ask
me to dance, I'll get out and do a <i>pas seul</i>!"</p>

<p>"I should like to see that <i>pas seul</i>, but first will
you do me the extreme honor to dance this with
me?" said Mr. Tucker, with mock grandiloquence.</p>

<p>"Dee-lighted!" gushed Mabel, and was soon
engaged in a boisterous hopping match with Mr.
Tucker.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>"I could kill Zebedee!" said Dum through
clenched teeth. "I believe that Binks thing came
through Richmond with the hope of meeting him,
and here he tumbles at the first shot and goes off
dancing with her as though it&mdash;&mdash; Oh, I can't
talk about it, it makes me so furious. Look how
they are romping, too! I dare Dee or me to
romp that way."</p>

<p>I could but recall the views Mr. Tucker had so
recently expressed to me about dancers who
hopped, and here he was jumping around like a
hen on a hot griddle, and as far as I could see,
enjoying himself very much. I sympathized with
Dum; while I did not feel called upon to get into
a rage and clench my teeth, I was a little disappointed
in my kind host. I felt very young and
shy all of a sudden. Mabel, as she triumphantly
bore off the prize, had in a most condescending
way tossed me her handkerchief and gloves with
a "Here, child, hold these for me!" That I
would not do. The heavy smell of musk that
hung around all of Mabel's belongings sickened
me; and why should she make a catch-all of me,
anyhow? I put them down disdainfully on a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
chair, meeting with Dum's hearty approval by
my act, and then had a nice quiet dance with
Father, who proved to be as good a partner as
one could want.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>DINNER AT COUSIN PARK'S.</div>


<p>Sunday dawned and with it the consciousness
that I had to go through the ordeal of dinner
with Cousin Park. Oh, how I hated the thought
of it! We had slept late after the unusual hours
we had kept the night before, and Mr. Tucker
had kindly had our breakfast sent up from the
caf&eacute;.</p>

<p>"That's to make up for treating us the way he
did last night," said Dum, buttering her cakes
as she sat up in bed.</p>

<p>"Treating us what way?" inquired Dee.</p>

<p>"Dancing with that Binks abomination. He
knew he had no business to do it."</p>

<p>"Why, Dum," I said, determined to cool her
down if possible, "I don't really see how Mr.
Tucker could have done otherwise. A schoolmate
who from all appearances is devoted to his
daughters, joins our group and lets it be known<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
that she is dying to dance, indeed is thinking of
dancing alone. Why, there was no way for a
gentleman to behave than just exactly as Zeb&mdash;I
mean Mr. Tucker&mdash;did behave. I would have
been pleased if my Father had done exactly as
yours did, and I believe Father would if her innuendos
had been addressed to him."</p>

<p>"Well, Doctor Allison would never have
hopped as Zebedee did. What I hate to think
about is the way that girl is going to tell all the
girls at school about our handsome young Father
and how he devoted himself to her. I bet she
comes here to-day on some pretext or other."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll sic Brindle on her if she does. He
can't stand cats!" hissed Dee, who was becoming
worked up by Dum's evident passion.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell you one thing: the ruder you
are to Mabel the more polite your Father will
be; and the more polite you are, the more indifferent
Mr. Tucker will be," I admonished.</p>

<p>"How did you get so wise, old Solomon?"
asked Dum, in rather muffled tones through a
mouthful of flannel cakes.</p>

<p>"Why, Mammy Susan says, 'Men folks an'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
mules is moughty sim'lar; jes' nachally contrary-wise.
Ef yer want 'em ter go ter de mill, make
out dey's got ter stay in de parsture, an' jes' ter
spite yer dey'll run all de way ter de mill.'"</p>

<p>"Well, we'll make out Zebedee has got to go
to the mill and he'll want to stay in the pasture.
Mabel Binks is more like a mill than a pasture,"
said Dum, rather taken with my philosophy.</p>

<p>"Yes, and 'All is grist that comes to her mill,'
too," declared Dee. "I am going to try the plan
on Zebedee this minute," and she bounced up and
donning slippers and kimono went in to the living
room where Mr. Tucker was deep in the Sunday
paper. She left the door slightly ajar and
Dum and I could plainly hear the conversation.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Zebedee," and the sound of a
hearty kiss. "It was awfully good of you to have
breakfast sent up to us. We did not mean to
oversleep."</p>

<p>"Glad to do it, Tweedledeedles. I thought all
of you would be tired after tripping the light
fantastic toe almost into Sunday morning."</p>

<p>"Say, Zebedee, Page has to go to her Cousin
Park's to dinner to-day, so don't you think it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
would be nice to have Mabel Binks to dinner
with us?"</p>

<p>Dum gasped and started to rush into the sitting
room, without the formality of a kimono,
but I grabbed her and with a warning finger
quieted her.</p>

<p>"Oh, come now, Dee, I should think you and
Dum would be content to spend your last Sunday
at home quietly with your poor old lonesome
Zebedee. I can't see what you want with Miss
Binks. She is much older than you, Tweedles,
and not a bit the kind of person I should encourage
you to have as an intimate. I get the names
of your schoolmates mixed, but wasn't she the
girl you wrote me was so purse-proud and unfeeling
in her treatment of that nice ladylike
little girl from Price's Landing?"</p>

<p>"Ye&mdash;s, but I thought you liked her pretty well
last night."</p>

<p>"Why, I never gave her a thought! She so
plainly asked me to dance with her that I had
to do it; but that was all. She is showily handsome
and amusing enough in the daring way in
which she talks, but nay, nay, not for me!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>More sounds of kissing, and then: "Now run on
and all of you get dressed in a hurry so we can
take a nice spin with Henry Ford and go to
church before Miss Page has to be delivered
over to the Dragon."</p>

<p>"What's that smell, Zebedee? The hall is
reeking with a terrible odor," asked Dee, sniffing
suspiciously.</p>

<p>"I can't imagine. I was afraid you and Dum
and Miss Page had gone in for musk. The
whole apartment is permeated with it." Dee
went out into the little hall connecting the girls'
bedroom with the living room and poked around
the hatrack, where the odor seemed to be
strongest.</p>

<p>"Here it is," she cried, "in your overcoat
pocket!"</p>

<p>"Oh, that wretched girl's gloves! She asked
me to hold them for her just before we left the
club, and I must have put them in my pocket.
Hang 'em outside the bathroom window. That
smell is enough to make all of us faint. Please
turn my pocket inside out, so it can air."</p>

<p>"What did I tell you?" and Dee burst into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
the bedroom, waving the smelly gloves as she
came; "the minx made Zebedee keep her gloves
just so she could get around here. We'd better
dress in a hurry so we can be ready to receive
her. She might eat up poor Zebedee without his
knowing what got him," and she scornfully hung
the offensive kids out the bathroom window.</p>

<p>Mabel Binks did come before Dum and I were
quite dressed, but Dee was installed in the living
room waiting for her with Brindle at her side
ready to sic on Mabel if she showed signs of
walking off with the handsome young father.</p>

<p>"Oh, you naughty man, I am almost sure you
purloined my gloves last night!" we heard her
say, in her loud and strident tones. "I thought
I would stop in on the way to church to get
them."</p>

<p>"Yes, he did hook them from you," said Dum,
making her appearance like a whirlwind. "Zebedee
is great on that. He steals girls' gloves
all the time and gives them to Dee and me. We
never have to buy any. All the girls get him to
hold their gloves for them and then he brings
them home to us and we divide them up. Here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
yours are. Zebedee did not know whose they
were, but we recognized the perfume you are so
fond of. They are too big for us, so we were
not going to row over them." Mr. Tucker sat
dumfounded during this tirade of Dum's, and
as for me, I had to dive back in the room from
which I was emerging to get my countenance
straightened out.</p>

<p>Dee buried her nose in Brindle's neck and
made such a funny little noise trying to keep
back her laughter that Brindle growled and
wrinkled up his neck in a most ominous manner.
Mabel took the gloves, and for once her aplomb
deserted her. She beat a hasty retreat with good-bys
that were scarcely audible.</p>

<p>I fully expected that Mr. Tucker would admonish
Dum for the ridiculous fabrication of
which she had been guilty, but he seemed to forget
all about the behavior befitting a parent, and
caught us by the hand and in a moment we were
dancing the Lobster Quadrille and singing lustily,
"Will you, won't you, won't you, will you,
will you join the dance?"</p>

<p>"Now hurry up and get on your hats and jackets<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
and we will speed little Henry Ford to
church." And off we went in a Christian frame
of mind and at peace with the whole world, especially
Dum, who had scored heavily over the detested
Mabel.</p>

<p>The hour for dinner at Cousin Park's had at
last come. How slowly I walked up the broad
stone steps leading to her fine house! The same
lugubrious butler opened the door that had performed
that office when I visited Cousin Park
on that other memorable occasion. He had the
air of one who is letting in the mourners. I involuntarily
glanced at the door bell to see if by
any chance cr&ecirc;pe could be hanging from it.</p>

<p>This butler's appropriate name was Jeremiah,
and he was what is known as "a blue-gum nigger."
I smiled when I greeted him, and for a
moment he showed his blue gums in a vain attempt
at cheerfulness, but he quickly subsided
into his habitual gloom. I recalled what Mammy
Susan had said to me many a time. "Be mighty
keerful, honey; don' nebber cross a blue-gum
nigger, fer de bite er one is rank pizen and sho
death."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>Cousin Park was seated in state in her ugly,
handsome, oiled-walnut parlor. The room was
of noble proportions and might have been pretty,
but Cousin Park had happened to marry the
genial Major at the period when oiled walnut
was the prevailing style, and her whole life had
been built on the oiled-walnut basis ever since.
Her costly velvet carpets still came right to the
edge of the floor and were snugly tacked close
to the baseboard. No hardwood floors and rugs
for her.</p>

<p>The heavy furniture was deeply carved, and
if the unwary visitor forgot himself for a moment
and attempted to lounge in his chair he was
quickly brought to a sense of propriety by a
carved pineapple getting him between his shoulders
or maybe a bunch of grapes striking him in
the small of his back. I usually tried to sit on
the horsehair sofa. Long practice in riding
bareback had given me a poise that enabled me
to be very comfortable seated thus without sliding
off. The pictures were hung close up to the
ceiling according to the style in vogue in times
gone by. They were mostly dark portraits in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
heavy gilt frames and they glared down at you as
though they resented your intrusion into their
mausoleum.</p>

<p>Father was seated forward in his chair, trying
to avoid the pineapple, and on his face was
an expression like that of a little boy who has
been taken to church and fears every minute to
be questioned as to the text. I rather expected
our stern relative to tell him to go wash his
hands for dinner. He jumped up and hugged
me enthusiastically, and I felt ashamed that I
had hated so to come. Cousin Park gave me an
upholstered embrace and I made for the horsehair
sofa, that seemed friendly and yielding in
comparison with Cousin Park.</p>

<p>"Well, so you have torn yourself away from
those Tuckers long enough to do your duty, have
you?" I scented a battle from afar, but determined
to be good and not say anything to make
my cousin angry. No doubt she was hungry and
would be more agreeable as soon as dinner was
announced.</p>

<p>"It is kind of you to ask me to dinner, Cousin
Park, and I am glad to come," I meekly replied.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
And thinking maybe it would be tactful to
change the subject, I said to Father: "How do
you feel after dancing last night?"</p>

<p>"Fine, daughter; I never had such a good time
in my life."</p>

<p>"Cousin James! You&mdash;dancing! You are
surely jesting&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;a man of your age!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not so awfully old, Cousin Park!
There were men on the floor ten years older
than I am&mdash;bank presidents, eminent surgeons,
and several judges, all dancing the new dances
with the utmost abandon."</p>

<p>"Well, where on earth did you learn the new
dances, Cousin James?"</p>

<p>"Well, I never saw them danced before, so it
must have been by a correspondence course."
And Father winked at me.</p>

<p>The sepulchral butler came in to announce dinner
just at this crucial moment when his irate
mistress looked as though she would burst her
tight black satin basque in which she had been
so compactly hooked. He quavered in a sad
voice: "Dinner is served," but his tone reminded
me of Jeremiah, Chapter IX, first verse: "Oh,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
that my head were waters and mine eyes a fountain
of tears that I might weep day and night!"</p>


<p>The dining room was one degree more cheerful
than the parlor, as instead of the portraits
there were Audubon prints and the Marriage of
Pocahontas. A heavy walnut sideboard laden
with massive silver almost filled one side of the
room. The table was precisely set and the food
may have been good, but everything was so ponderous,
including the hostess, that when we got
through with the long tiresome courses I felt
like the old wolf that Mammy Susan used to tell
about. He swallowed seven little kids whole
and then, while he slept by the water's edge, the
Widow Goat came and ripped him open, took out
the dear little kids and put in their place seven
huge stones. The old wolf was naturally thirsty
after this surgical operation, and so was I when
I had packed in and hammered down roast
chicken, boiled hominy, mashed potatoes, baked
rice, macaroni and I don't know what besides,
except that we topped off with a plum pudding
that was the last straw.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 334px;">
<img src="images/tucker04.png" width="334" height="500" alt="Dum looked at me aghast. &quot;Page, you here, and Dee!&quot;&mdash;Page 271." title="" />
<span class="caption">Dum looked at me aghast. &quot;Page, you here, and Dee!&quot;&mdash;Page 271.</span>
</div>

<p>I longed for sleep with an intensity that was
truly painful, and I could see that poor dear
Father was desperate. The conversation at the
table was as heavy and starchy as the food.
Father and I could not help comparing it to the
gay little dinner we had enjoyed the night before
at the Country Club.</p>

<p>Cousin Park's manner was always dictatorial,
even when she was the visitor instead of the hostess,
and on that day she seemed to think she
was born to boss the Universe. She picked on
me most of the time and I let her do it, knowing
Father must have had his share of correction,
but when she began on my friends, the
darling Tuckers, I got a little restive. Mammy
Susan always told me: "Don't sass old folks
till dey fust sass you," and I began to feel that
old folks were sassing me considerably. I smiled
to myself, remembering that Mr. Tucker had
told me that when the Major died, at his funeral
they sang "Peace, perfect peace," and the pall
bearers themselves could hardly keep from grinning
to think what a far from peaceful time the
poor Major had had on earth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>Father came to my rescue when our masterful
cousin finally sprung this mine on us: "I am astonished,
Cousin James, that you should have
no more sense of propriety than to let Page visit
that Jeffry Tucker without a chaperon."</p>

<p>"Why, Cousin Park, you astonish me! Page
is visiting Mr. Tucker's daughters, her schoolmates.
They are all three very young to have
a question of propriety brought up."</p>

<p>"I don't care, a woman is never too young or
too old to be made the subject of gossip," and
Cousin Park creaked ominously.</p>

<p>"Well, that being the case, I think it is highly
improper and imprudent for me to be visiting
you, unless we can look upon Jeremiah as a
chaperon."</p>

<p>And Cousin Park, knowing herself to be
worsted, sighed a great, heaving sigh and looked
sadly at the Major's portrait, as though if he
had been alive he would have protected her.</p>

<p>How glad we were to hear the toot of Henry
Ford and to know that our time in purgatory
was over. The fresh air took away that awful
drowsiness, and the cheerful talk of the Tuckers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
as we spun out into the country made us forget
the deadly conversation we had been forced to
be a party to. Father had an engagement for
supper with a medical brother, and he was to go
back to Bracken the next day.</p>

<p>"Blood may be thicker than water," he said.
"In fact, to-day it was so thick you couldn't stir
it, but never again do I intend to make a visit at
Cousin Park Garnett's. Why, I feel as though
that blue-gum nigger had bitten me."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE DESPERATION OF DUM.</div>


<p>Back at Gresham and trying to get into harness!
Some of us kicked over the traces, feeling
our oats, as it were; and Dum got the bit
between her teeth and came very near running
all the way home before we could stop her.</p>

<p>It was hard to get into what Mr. Mantilini
calls "the demnition grind" after three weeks of
untrammeled freedom. The whole school seemed
restive and the teachers were not much better
than the pupils. Miss Peyton had to drive her
coach very carefully. Her infinite tact showed
itself constantly. A word of warning here, a
slight tightening of the reins there, just a little
tap to the ones who seemed inclined to laziness,
and soon we were trotting along the road of
knowledge just as though we had not been kicking
up our heels in the green pastures. All but
Dum, she could not get back to work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>"If the year were only half over, but it's only
the middle of January now! We've got months
and months to wait before we see Zebedee again.
When we once get into February, I can stand it
better. I can't and won't study, and as for demerits&mdash;let
'em give me all they want to. Let
'em put me in bounds. I don't want to go off
of the old place. What fun is it to walk down
into that dinky little village keeping step like
convicts? I'd rather have striped clothes like
convicts than these old stupid blue things. There
is some variety in stripes but this eternal, and
everlasting dark blue&mdash;ugh! I hate it!"</p>

<p>"But, Dum," I expostulated, "if you get so
many demerits you will not only be in bounds
but you'll have to write pages and pages of dictionary."</p>

<p>"I'll see 'em make me. 'You can lead a horse
to water but you cannot make him drink.' They
can tell me to write the dictionary all they want
to, but I've yet to see the man, woman, or child
who can make me write anything. I just won't
and that's an end of it."</p>

<p>"But what will your Father think?" I asked,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
hoping to get on her better side by appealing to
her love for her adored Zebedee.</p>

<p>"Think? 'He can think like young niggers
think: buckeyes is biscuit.'"</p>

<p>This made me roar, as it was a saying I had
told the twins that Mammy Susan had taught
me when I was a child. There was no persuading
the headstrong Dum. She had the bit between
her teeth and she was rushing straight to
destruction. She got zero in her classes during
the day, and that night in study hall she spent
the time making cunning little brownies out of
the colored clay she had brought in her pocket.
She did not open a book except for the purpose
of propping it up on her desk to conceal the little
lifelike figures she was so busy modeling.</p>

<p>Dee gazed at her with an agonized expression
on her face and I gave her many an appealing
glance, but she merely made a face at me and
went on with her sculpture. Where was it to
end? Zero for that day's lessons and many preceding
days; and not a single one prepared for
next day. She seemed perfectly careless of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
teacher who was keeping study hall, as though
she invited reproval; but it so happened that Miss
Sears, who was on duty that night, did not seem
to notice Dum's behavior. When the study hall
was over, the reckless girl picked up all her
brownies and carried them carefully on her open
book up to her room, right under Miss Sears's
nose.</p>

<p>"She must be crazy," whispered Dee to me,
"and Miss Sears must be in love or blind or
something. She didn't see how Dum was cutting
up."</p>

<p>"Well, Dum was certainly reckless. I thought
every minute she was going to be called down.
You've got to be either good or careful, and
Dum was certainly neither."</p>

<p>Miss Sears beckoned to me and I fell back, and
the Tuckers went on to 117.</p>

<p>"Page," said Miss Sears, "Miss Peyton is
rather worried over Virginia Tucker. Of course
I saw how she was conducting herself during
study hall, but Miss Peyton has decided the best
way to get hold of Dum is to let her alone for a
while. The rest of the school is back in working<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
order, but she is as wild as a deer. Miss Peyton
asked me to take you into our confidence and
see if you can help us some. Will you keep a
pretty sharp eye on Dum?"</p>

<p>"You mean tell on her if she gets into
scrapes?" I asked, flushing painfully.</p>

<p>"My dear girl, no. You would not be the kind
we would go to if we wanted an informer. We
want you to try to influence Dum to quiet down,
and let her realize that she must get to work.
Demerits seem to have no effect on her. I verily
believe she enjoys getting as many as she can.
You have lots of influence with those girls, and
I believe a talk from you would do her more
good than being brought up before the faculty,"
and Miss Sears looked at me very kindly.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll do my best but I can't promise that
Dum will listen to me." I did not like to say that
I had already done what I could, but I determined
to try, try again.</p>

<p>Dum had her brownies ranged in a line on the
bureau and under each she had tucked one of
her visiting cards, on which she had written
something. Dee looked sad and Dum defiant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>"I was just telling Dum," began Dee.</p>

<p>"Never mind what you were telling Dum," interrupted
the outrageous girl. "It's none of your
business nor is it Page Allison's if I get into
scrapes. I reckon I'm old enough to take care
of myself without the assistance of persons no
older nor wiser than I am."</p>

<p>"So you are, but you owe a penny for interrupting
Dee; that's twenty-five cents since the
holidays," I said sternly.</p>

<p>"I don't care if I do. I don't intend to pay it.
I need my money for other things besides this
foolishness."</p>

<p>I looked at Dum in amazement. She and Dee
often were rude to each other but in the three
months that I had known them, neither one of
them had been anything but scrupulously polite
to me. I realized that silence would be the better
part of valor in this encounter, so I prepared
for bed without saying a word. I gave a warning
glance at Dee, and she, ever tactful, held her
peace. Dum was evidently disappointed, as she
was simply "sp'iling for a fight."</p>

<p>We got to bed as lights out bell rang and in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
a moment everything was perfectly quiet. I did
not go to sleep immediately but pondered over
what Miss Sears had said. "How can I best help
Dum?" I asked myself. I must keep an eye on
her and still not let her know it. It was hard
to take her rudeness without giving her as good
as she sent, but I felt that a real loss of temper
on my part would mean an equal loss of influence.
I dropped off to sleep with Dum on my
mind.</p>

<p>It must have been a little after midnight when
I awakened, and something prompted me to
glance at Dum's bed. It was a bright night, the
moon not full, but big enough to make everything
in the room visible. A light snow was on
the ground, which aided the lighting powers of
the moon by reflection.</p>

<p>Dum's bed was empty. Her nightgown was
on the floor and her clothes which I had seen her
throw on the chair near her bed were gone. I
got up in an excitement that made my heart go
like a trip hammer and found her hat and jacket
gone, too.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
"Dee, Dee," I said in as quiet a voice as I
could command, "Dum is gone!"</p>

<p>"Gone! Gone where?" said poor sleepy Dee.</p>

<p>"I don't know, but it is up to us to find out.
Get into your clothes as fast as you can. I don't
believe she has been gone long, her bed is so
warm."</p>

<p>I had felt it as soon as I jumped out of mine.
Dee shuddered at this announcement of mine.
She said afterward it sounded like the report of
a coroner's inquest.</p>

<p>Fire engine horses could not have sprung into
their harness quicker than Dee and I did into our
clothes. In a twinkling we were wrapped in our
warm sweaters and had donned hats and rubbers,
the last not only because of the snow but
to deaden our footsteps down the long corridors.
I got ready a moment sooner than Dee
and I struck a match and read one of the cards
Dum had stuck under the little clay brownies:
"To Miss Peyton as a parting token of appreciation
of her discipline." I gasped with astonishment.
Dum was crazy surely, perfectly daft.</p>

<p>"What is on the card?" asked Dee anxiously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, just some of Dum's nonsense! Hurry!"
I did not think I had better tell Dee. It sounded
like a last farewell.</p>

<p>We found the front door unlocked. She had
certainly gone out recently, as the watchman
made his rounds every hour and it was then
12:20 by the big clock in the hall. I know the
wisest thing for us to have done would have been
to warn the watchman and let Miss Peyton
know, but somehow I felt that we could cope
with Dum by ourselves; and I also knew that
the offense that Dum was guilty of was a very
serious one and might mean that she would be
expelled from Gresham.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Gave a luster of midday to objects below."</span><br />
</div>

<p>So, thank goodness, the prints of Dum's tennis
shoes were quite plain to us. I was relieved
to see that they went toward the village. I had
had a nameless fear of the lake. On we sped!
Once we saw where poor Dum had evidently
paused and then turned back for a few yards.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
That encouraged me more than anything we had
found out yet. She was softening and relenting.</p>

<p>"What do you suppose she means to do,
Page?" panted Dee.</p>

<p>"She is trying to make that 12:40 train to
Richmond. There she is!"</p>

<p>We had turned a sharp corner and there about
a hundred yards ahead of us was Dum. She had
almost reached the crossing where Captain Leahy
had his unique abode. One minute more would
land her at the station, and already we could
hear the far-off whizzing of the approaching express.
There was a light in the little gatehouse
and just at that moment the dear old man
emerged and began to let down his gate.</p>

<p>"Well, Saints preserve us! And what maid
travels so late? Why, if she isn't one of the
sponsors of Oliver." Dum stopped stockstill in
the road.</p>

<p>"Captain Leahy, I'm going to take that midnight
train to Richmond. Will you flag it for
me?"</p>

<p>"And sure I'll do anything to please the ladies,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
but aren't ye young and tinder to be after taking
such a thrip at this toime o' night?"</p>

<p>"But I have to go. I could never go back
to Gresham now, and it would be best for me to
go straight to my Father."</p>

<p>Dee and I had advanced silently, thanks to
our rubber shoes, and we now came up behind
the old Irishman and Dum.</p>

<p>"Come on, Dum, you can get back to Gresham
before the watchman makes his one o'clock
rounds if you hurry."</p>

<p>Dum looked at me aghast. "Page, you here,
and Dee!"</p>

<p>"Where should I be but with my twin? We
have never spent a night apart yet, Dumplingdeedledums."
Dee's tact had won the day. That
was Mr. Tucker's pet name for Dum, and Dee
using it at such a time brought Dum to her
senses. "What would Zebedee think and say of
this escapade?" was what came to Dum's mind.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Captain, I reckon I won't go to
Richmond to-night. We'll have to hurry to get
in before one. That's the 12:40 now whistling
for the crossing." And before the old man could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
get his breath, we had scurried away over the
light fall of snow like so many rabbits.</p>

<p>It was uphill most of the way back to Gresham,
but we made short work of it. If I had
not been so desperately afraid the watchman
would discover that the front door was unlocked
before we got back and perhaps raise an alarm,
I would have enjoyed our run immensely. The
moon went behind a great black cloud, but we
knew our way well enough not to be dependent on
her light. Not one word did we speak, but saved
our breath for this real fox-trot.</p>

<p>At the school at last! I tried the great door,
almost afraid to breathe. It yielded to my push
and we were in the dark hall. I had just sense
enough left to lock the door, and then we flew
up the steps and were safe in our room without
having encountered the watchman.</p>

<p>"Quick work!" I gasped, falling on my bed.
"Down to the station and back in forty minutes!"</p>

<p>But safety was not ours yet. We heard a
door open down the corridor and light-slippered
steps approaching 117.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>"In bed with you, quick!" exclaimed Dum;
and without the formality of night dresses, we
jumped into bed, only taking the precaution to
remove our hats. Diving under the covers with
only our noses sticking out, we were to all appearances
as lost to the world as the seven sleepers.</p>

<p>It was a teacher who had evidently heard a
suspicious noise and had come out to investigate.
She stopped a minute in front of our door and
then gently turned the knob. "All quiet along
the Potomac!" She stood a minute listening to
Dum's "gently taken breath" and Dee's lifelike
snore, and then quietly retired on tiptoe; and in
a moment we heard her door close at the end of
the corridor. If we got dressed like engine
horses going to a fire, we got undressed like
boys seeing who can get into the swimming hole
first.</p>

<p>Dum kissed us both good-night, or rather
good-morning, but said never a word about what
her intentions had been nor the reasons for her
flitting. We were asleep in a minute and the
next morning I had to pinch myself to see if it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
had not been a dream. Our damp skirts and
overshoes and each girl's hat under her bed was
all that made me realize that we had been on
that mad chase at midnight after the irrepressible
Dum.</p>

<p>"Girls, you are both bricks!" exclaimed Dum,
rubbing her eyes as the relentless rising bell
tolled out. "Just think! If you had not come
for me, I would have been in Richmond by this
time and poor old Zebedee disgraced for life.
There is nothing I can do to make it up to
you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, there is," chorused Dee and me, "get to
work again."</p>

<p>"I wasn't quite through what I was saying,
but I am not going to impose the fine that you
owe for interrupting, and I am going to pay my
fine that amounts to a quarter now. I was awfully
ashamed of not paying it last night, but
you see I just did have enough money to get
me to Richmond if I traveled on a day coach,
so I had to let my debts of honor slide. I have
been a bad, rude, unreasonable girl and I am
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>just as sorry as I can be. I deserve to be expelled.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I don't know what has been the matter</span><br />
with me but I believe I have been getting ready
to go to the home for the criminally insane. I
hated the school; I hated the teachers; I hated
lessons and rules; I just wanted Zebedee. He
was the only person I wanted and I wanted him
so bad I was just going to have him." Dum got
out one of the gentlemen's handkerchiefs that
she and Dee used and wept copiously. "Do you
reckon we'll be found out?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," I reassured her. "The
blessed snow that was in that black cloud hiding
the moon last night has covered up all our rabbit
tracks, and when we take our walk this afternoon
I am going to slip out of line long enough
to warn Captain Leahy not to tell on us. Now,
Dum, you get back to bed and stay there all day.
I am going to tell Miss Peyton you don't feel
quite up to snuff, which is certainly so. You
jump in and study all your back lessons that you
have missed and catch up with your classes. It
will take a day of diligent work to do it because
you have loafed ever since we got back to school,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
and by to-morrow morning you will feel reconciled
to life and take your place again."</p>

<p>"Well, that would be kind of pleasant, but
bring me up enough breakfast, 'cause I am not
too ill to eat; and before you go down, hand me
those brownies I made last night," and Dum
reduced the inoffensive little works of art to Limbo
with one squeeze of her hand. "I was leaving
one of them for each teacher. I wanted to
make them into devils but thought maybe that
would be a little too sassy. I don't feel a bit
that way now. I may model some angels to-day
if I can get time after I have mastered all
my back work."</p>

<p>Miss Peyton was easily persuaded by me that
a day in bed would restore Dum to health and
reason. She said she had hoped I could do something
with the refractory twin and she was going
to trust to me, since I was a doctor's daughter
and no doubt had inherited some skill as a
healer.</p>

<p>That afternoon, when we took our walk, Dee
and I got permission from the teacher in charge
to stop a moment at the crossing, presumably<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
to call on Oliver and see how much he had
grown.</p>

<p>"Captain Leahy," I cried, "you won't tell anyone
about our being down here last night, will
you?"</p>

<p>"And phwat do ye take me for?" he asked.
"Didn't I see that ye were after saving the little
twinlet and that she was crazy with homesickness?
I mind too well the time many years
ago when I got off of that very express just as
Miss Peyton, then a wee slip of a maid, was
after boarding it; and I took her by the hand and
led her back to Gresham, she weeping bitterly
all the toime. She was half mad for the sight
of her folks and had run away from school."</p>

<p>"Miss Peyton!" we exclaimed in one breath.
"Not Miss Peyton, the principal?"</p>

<p>"The same," he answered; "and this is the first
toime, so help me, that I have mintioned it to a
livin' sowl."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll never tell, Captain," I said, grasping
his hand.</p>

<p>"And don't I know that? Would I be divulging
the loiks to ye if I did not know the stoof<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
ye are made of? I just tell ye so ye can know
that I'll keep the little twinlet's secret as long
as I have Miss Peyton's. If I iver tell it, it will
be when she cannot be hurt by it, and some other
poor little lamb can be oop-lifted."</p>

<p>"You want us to tell Dum, don't you?" asked
Dee.</p>

<p>"For sure! And all of you come have tea with
me soon and bring Miss Peyton."</p>

<p>We joined the line of blue-coated girls after
a sharp run and then had to make up things to
say about Oliver, because we had forgot even to
ask about him.</p>

<p>Miss Cox spoke to me on the way to supper
that evening. She looked worried and her face
was crookeder than ever, but her eyes had a very
kind light in them.</p>

<p>"Did I wake you last night, Page, when I
opened your door?"</p>

<p>"Oh, was that you?" I involuntarily exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I had an idea some of you were awake," and
the kindly woman smiled at my ingenuous acknowledgment.
"I was afraid to knock, hoping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
you were asleep, so I tried the door and peeped
in. I did not mean to be spying, but I have been
very uneasy about Dum lately. I was afraid she
needed some friendly advice. I had been writing
late and had not been able to get to sleep,
and I was almost certain I heard the front door
open and shut. I simply could not rest without
making sure that you three girls were safe in
your downies. I had thought I heard something
some forty minutes before but tried to make myself
think I was just a foolish, nervous old maid."</p>

<p>I felt very foolish during this talk and could
hardly look kind Miss Cox in the eye, but I did
not consider it to be my secret and I said nothing.
Mammy Susan always said: "The saftest
thing in fly time is ter keep yo' mouf shet," and
I felt that this was fly time for me.</p>

<p>"I have written to Mr. Tucker," Miss Cox
continued. "I don't want the twins to know it,
but I felt it was my duty as an old friend of
both their parents to let him know how miserable
Dum is."</p>

<p>"Oh, I have written, too!" I cried. "I wish I
could stop my letter now, but it is too late. Poor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
Mr. Tucker will think things are in a terrible
way with Dum. I believe she is herself again
now after a day in bed, but I just felt I must let
him know that an early visit from him would be
advisable. I wouldn't let Tweedles find out for
a million that I have done it."</p>

<p>"Well, you keep my secret and I'll keep yours.
I am glad the Tuckers, father and daughters,
have such a wholesome friend as you," and Miss
Cox pressed my hand warmly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MORE LETTERS.</div>


<div class="center">From Miss Jane Cox to Mr. Jeffry Tucker.</div>

<div class="blockquot">My dear Jeff:

<p>I feel it my duty to write you in regard to
your daughter Virginia. I told you I would look
after your girls and I have tried to, but since
the holidays Dum has been very difficult and the
teachers hardly know how to cope with her. My
private opinion is that the child is longing so for
you that she is in a fair way to be made sick by
it. A vacation of three weeks seems to be very
upsetting and a great many of the pupils find
it hard to get back into line, but Dum does not
even want to, so far as I can see.</p>

<p>I do not mean to complain of Dum. You surely
understand that, but I want to let you know
the state of affairs. I am writing entirely on
my own hook as your friend and the friend of
the other little Virginia, companion of my
youth. I fancy Miss Peyton would not approve
of my doing it, as she feels able to master poor
Dum by kindness; but I have studied her closely
and feel that I understand her temperament better
than our beloved principal. I have been
afraid the child might take it into her head to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
run away from school. It is not that she does
not like Gresham. I believe she likes it very
much. She is popular with the whole school and
has many friends. She is a good student and
has done well up to the time she returned from
Richmond. Since that time her marks have been
zero.</p>

<p>Page Allison, who has a very good influence
on all the girls with whom she comes in contact,
is looking after her and she may be able to bring
her to reason; but in the meantime, my dear
Jeff, I want you to write to Dum very often,&mdash;of
course not mentioning the fact that you have
heard from me,&mdash;and give her hopes of a visit
from you in the near future. That would mean
everything to her.</p>

<p>Of course, an attempt to run away from school
would be a very serious fault if discovered, because
of the effect on the rest of the pupils. I
don't want to alarm you, but I feel that I would
be a poor friend indeed if I did not let you know
of the trouble your little daughter is in a fair
way to get herself into. Dee is back at work
and doing finely, although as a rule she is not
a better student than Dum. I am told that during
study hall this evening Dum made no effort
to concentrate on her lessons, but spent the whole
time modeling grotesque little figures in colored
clay.</p>

<p>Hoping you will take this information as it is
meant, not thinking that I am a "tattle tale tit,"
but that I have the welfare of the children of
my old friends very much at heart, and that it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
would be a cowardly and selfish act for me to
hold back for fear of being misunderstood, I am,</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 3em;">Your sincere friend,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Jinny Cox</span>.<br />
</div></div>


<div class="center"><br />From Mr. Jeffry Tucker to Miss Jane Cox.</div>

<div class="blockquot">Jinny dear:

<p>You always were a trump, and I can never express
to you the gratitude I feel for the letter
you have written me about my poor little headstrong
Dum. She was particularly docile about
returning to school, but as I told her good-by at
the station she had a kind of smoldering look in
her eyes that bodest no good. She has the most
generous and kind heart in the world, but has
always been the more difficult of the twins to
manage. The matter is she has an artistic temperament,
but I have been trying to conceal this
fact from her all her life, as I think when a person
once discovers he has an artistic temperament,
he can commit any crime in the name of
his temperament and feel that the world must
forgive him. I want my little Virginia to understand
that it is up to her to behave just as
well as the ordinary folks who have no temperament
to speak of. I am writing to her by this
mail, but of course she is never to know you
wrote to me. I am coming up to Gresham for a
little visit just as soon as my strenuous duties
will permit, and then I hope we can have another
Lobster Quadrille.</p>

<p>I am very thankful that Tweedles has such a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
delightful companion as Miss Page Allison. She
has improved them more than all the schooling
in the world would. I am also thankful beyond
measure that they have found such a friend as
you are, dear Jinny. Keep on being good to
them and if Dum shows further signs of insubordination,
please telegraph me. I'll come, if no
newspaper is published from this office for a
month! Thanking you again, dear friend, in my
name and also for the little Virginia, companion
of your youth,</p>

<div class="sig">
<span style="margin-right: 3em;">Very truly yours,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Jeffry Tucker</span>.<br />
</div></div>


<div class="center"><br />From Page Allison to Mr. Jeffry Tucker.</div>

<div class="blockquot">Dear Mr. Tucker:

<p>I can't bear to worry you, but I think you
ought to know that Dum wants to see you mighty
bad. She has been very restless since we got
back to Gresham; and while she is quieter now
and says she is going to study hard and be a
model pupil henceforth, I am afraid she will
break down because she has so many demerits to
work off. Miss Peyton has been very kind and
patient, but of course it would not be fair to the
other students to let up on Dum; and I believe
she has enough demerits to keep her in bounds
for about three weeks.</p>

<p>Now please don't think I am bossy, but if you
could write her and tell her that you think you
might get up to Gresham in about three weeks,
that would give her some ambition to work off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
those marks and not get any others. You see,
if she is in bounds when you come, she can't see
much of you.</p>

<p>I don't want Tweedles to know I am writing
this to you, but if you should mention having
got a letter from me, you can call it a "bread
and butter letter."</p>

<p>You were so kind to me on my visit to the
girls. I had about the gayest and best time I
ever had in my life, and I do want to thank you
for it.</p>

<div class="sig">
<span style="margin-right: 3em;">Very sincerely,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Page Allison</span>.<br />
</div></div>


<div class="center"><br />Miss Page Allison, from Mr. Jeffry Tucker.</div>

<div class="blockquot">My dear Miss Page:

<p>Your word is law! In three weeks' time I will
be in Gresham. I don't consider you a bit bossy
but very sweet and kind and wise. Thank God,
my poor little Dum has made such a friend. I
wish I could flatter myself that I could call you
friend as my girls can. I thank you from my
soul for your interest in Tweedles.</p>

<div class="sig">
<span style="margin-right: 3em;">Most gratefully,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Jeffry Tucker</span>.<br />
</div></div>


<div class="center"><br />Mr. Jeffry Tucker to his daughters, Virginia and Caroline.</div>

<div class="blockquot">Dearest and best beloved Tweedles:

<p>Surely "'tis an ill wind that blows nobody any
good!" Know you that there has been a big<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
shooting scrape up in the mountains, and it is
of such importance that I have decided to cover
the trial myself instead of sending a reporter.
This trial comes off in a little over three weeks,
and as Gresham is on the way, I am going to
stop off to see my babies, and hope they will be
glad to have their old Zebedee with them for a
day or so. I'll manage to get there on Saturday
afternoon and stay until Monday night. Be
good girls until then, so you will not have any
hateful demerits to work off.</p>

<p>I miss you so much, more than I did at first,
but I'm trying to be a very good boy and stick
to business. I can hardly wait to see you. Give
my kindest regards to Miss Page, and tell her
not to get any demerits between now and the
time of my visit, as she must do whatever the
Tuckers do on that visit.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span class="smcap">Your own Zebedee.</span><br />

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>ZEBEDEE'S VISIT.</div>



<p>Mr. Tucker's promise of a visit did all that I
knew it would for Dum. She worked off her demerits
without a murmur; studied her lessons
diligently; soon caught up in her classes; and
was altogether an exemplary Dum.</p>

<p>If his promise of a visit worked such wonders,
his visit completed the miracle. We had
already come through our mid-year examinations,
some with flying colors and some with tattered
banners like the poor Confederate flags
that you see in the Valentine Museum in Richmond,&mdash;but
the thing was that we were through
and none of our little crowd of cronies had failed.
Annie Pore carried off the honors in Latin,
thanks to the drilling she had been brought up
on by the severe Oxford graduate. Dum was
easily first in mathematics. Dee seemed to know
the physiology off by heart. History was Mary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
Flannigan's forte and not a date from Noah's
flood to the San Francisco earthquake could
stump her. Literature was what most interested
me, and it would have been silly not to get an
honor when it did seem so easy.</p>

<p>We were rather proud of our achievements as
a coterie of chums, and Miss Peyton, as a reward
of merit, let all of us go to the station to
meet Mr. Tucker, accompanied by Miss Cox.</p>

<p>How good it was to see him! I believe I was
almost as glad as Tweedles. He looked very
boyish indeed as he swung off the Pullman, a
suitcase in one hand and a great basket, neatly
covered with purple paper, in the other.</p>

<p>"I know what that purple paper means," cried
Dee from afar. "He's been to Schmidt's and
that basket's full of goodies."</p>

<p>So he had, and, Zebedee like, had a proposition
for pleasure. I have seldom seen Mr.
Tucker that he did not have some scheme on
hand for amusement for someone, and the best
thing about it was that he usually was ready to
partake of the fun himself; and his partaking of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
it meant there was twice as much fun as there
would have been without him.</p>

<p>"There's skating on the lake surely?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes! Yes!" in chorus.</p>

<p>"Well, come along, and I'll get permission
from your Lord High Executioner to take all
of you skating, and we'll have supper on the
bank. What do you say to that, Jinny?"</p>

<p>"Splendid! I haven't skated for years,
though."</p>

<p>"Have you got your skates?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; you see this is all the home I have,
so I've got everything I possess here."</p>

<p>"And you girls? All of you have skates that
fit and shoes to skate in?"</p>

<p>"Yes! Yes!" And off we went, the gayest
crowd imaginable. Of course Miss Peyton let
us go. No one had ever refused Mr. Tucker
anything in reason, I am sure, nor had he ever
asked for anything out of reason.</p>

<p>"Will you have enough food for such a crowd?
Had you not better come back to Gresham to
supper?" asked Miss Peyton.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never fear. I have food enough for a dozen
boys. I'll take good care of all of them and
bring them back at bedtime."</p>

<p>There was another crowd on the lake when we
got there: a party of Greshamites, Juniors and
Seniors, and some boys from Hill-Top. The ice
was perfect, and while the air was cold, it was
not cutting but dry and invigorating. We put
our basket in a safe place; that is, a place where
everyone could see it. Mr. Tucker said the way
to lose things, especially food, was to hide it.
So he placed it on top of a little hillock overlooking
the lake, where it looked like a great
bunch of violets against the patches of snow.</p>

<p>Our skates did fit and our shoes were suitable,
so we were on the ice in no time. One of the
most irritating things under Heaven is to go
skating with persons whose skates don't fit or
whose heels are too high or soles too thin. I had
learned to skate on the duck pond at home; and
while on the duck pond my stroke had been necessarily
limited, I found when I got on the broad
lake I could hold my own very well.</p>

<p>Annie Pore was timid and faltering if she tried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
to skate alone but did very well if she had a
partner. Mary Flannigan, singularly ungraceful
but a real racer, with flapping arms and
bowed legs, could get over the ice faster than
the fleetest boy from Hill-Top. The twins skated
well, as they did everything in the way of athletics,
and wonderfully handsome they looked
skimming over the lake arm in arm.</p>

<p>Miss Cox was a revelation to us all. She had
not skated for years but her stroke was as sure
as it had ever been and in five minutes she and
Mr. Tucker were doing the double Dutch roll
together, now frontward, now backward, with
all kinds of intricate strokes. I suddenly realized
that with all of her crooked homeliness,
Miss Cox was far from plain. Her figure was
singularly graceful and her head very well set.</p>

<p>The boys cheered as they approached the far
bank, where the ice was a little better.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Who's all right? Who's all right?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Miss Cox, Miss Cox! Out of sight!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>I was supporting Annie Pore, so was necessarily
going slowly, and I heard one of the
Juniors say to Mabel Binks, who was looking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
very handsome in a red silk sweater and cap to
match: "Who's the man with Miss Cox? They
are some skaters, for sure."</p>

<p>"Oh, hello!" exclaimed Mabel. "If that ain't
my beau from Richmond!"</p>

<p>I did not hear any more, but I felt amused a
little and indignant a good deal. Harvie Price
was among the boys and he immediately skated
up and got in between Annie and me. He was
a strong skater and soon we found ourselves doing
stunts with him that we had not dreamed possible.</p>

<p>"That Dutch roll is not so hard when you get
the hang of it. See, like this&mdash;raise your right
foot, not too high&mdash;strike out with your left,
a good long stroke, and then down with your
right, crossing the left. Just look at us! We are
not quite up to Mr. Tucker and Miss Cox, but
we surely are good enough to have some notice
taken of us." And so we were.</p>

<p>"Pride goeth before a fall," however, and just
as we were getting the hang of the stroke, we
ran plump into Mary Flannigan and Shorty,
who were having a race backward, and the five<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
of us fell into an ignominious heap. Nobody
was hurt, not even feelings! Mr. Tucker picked
me up and skated off with me.</p>

<p>"Who was that good-looking young fellow you
were skating with?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that was Harvie Price. He's a mighty
nice boy, and an old friend of Annie Pore's."</p>

<p>"And that little runty boy with the bright
face, the cause of your recent disaster, who was
he?"</p>

<p>"Tommy Hawkins,&mdash;Shorty! Isn't he nice-looking?"</p>

<p>"Yes, very! I'm going to ask these boys to
stay and have supper with us. You introduce me,
and then I'll make myself known to the teacher
I see over there; and if I include him in the invitation,
maybe I can get permission for the
boys to stay."</p>

<p>Of course the boys were delighted and with a
great deal of finesse, Mr. Tucker ingratiated
himself into the affections of the teacher who
had them in charge, a Mr. Anderson, and he accepted
for himself with alacrity and gave the
boys permission.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish I had grub enough for the whole ship's
crew of them," sighed Mr. Tucker. "If there is
anything in the world I like, it is to give a boy
a treat. But seven of us and Mr. Anderson and
the two boys will just about clean up my basket.
I wanted to ask four boys so we could 'balance
all,' but I was so afraid of running short."</p>

<p>Mabel Binks had been circling around us, determined
to attract Mr. Tucker's attention. He
had given her a polite bow but held tightly to
my hands and skated on by her. She was a good
skater and her red sweater showed off her figure
to great advantage. Dum and Dee came racing
up to us and we all caught hold of hands and
went the length of the lake together.</p>

<p>"Don't we four get on well together, Zebedee?"
exclaimed Dee.</p>

<p>"We certainly do," he answered heartily.
"Miss Page seems to be just the oil needed to
make us, salt, pepper, vinegar, hot Tuckers into
a palatable dressing."</p>

<p>"Look here, Zebedee, it is up to you to skate
with that despicable thing, Mabel Binks," and
Dum looked sternly at her parent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't see it that way," he answered coolly.</p>

<p>"Well, you see she has gone around claiming
you as her Richmond beau who came up to Gresham
to see her, and now she says that I won't
let you skate with her."</p>

<p>"Too bad, that," he laughed. "Well, honey,
you can tell her that you have no influence over
me at all. You could not keep me from skating
with her nor can you make me do it."</p>

<p>The machinations of Mabel, however, were beyond
our ken. She came bearing down on us,
all sails spread as it were. We tacked as best
we could, but the determined girl turned at that
moment and skated backward right into our line.
Dee, who was next to me, broke and avoided
her, but I got the collision full force and went
down with an awful whack, with Mabel's hundred
and fifty pounds right on top of me.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"The best laid schemes o' mice an' men,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Gang aft a-gley."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Mabel had meant to occupy the center of the
stage herself, and here was I, Page Allison,
knocked senseless for a moment by the fall, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
Mabel was simply pulled off me by the infuriated
Zebedee and left to shift for herself. Dum
said she looked awfully silly as she got unaided
to her feet. Of course I could see nothing, as
I was so dazed by the fall that at first I lay with
my eyes closed. In a moment the crowd of
skaters had gathered, and Dee told me it was like
a dog fight, everybody trying to see at once.</p>

<p>"Page, little Page, are you dead?" were the
first words that I heard, and Mr. Tucker's face
the first one I saw.</p>

<p>"Dead? I should say not! I'm not even hurt.
Let me get up," and I caught hold of his ready
hand and struggled to my feet.</p>

<p>"She's not hurt! She's all right!" he called to
the anxious Tweedles who had been pushed back
by the curious crowd, and he wiped the ever-ready
tears from his eyes. Then the boys from
Hill-Top gave me a yell, our especial yell that
we sophomores used at moments of supreme victory:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Ice cream&mdash;soda water&mdash;ginger ale, pop!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Sophomores! Sophomores! Always on top!"</span><br />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish I had been," I said ruefully; and there
was a general laugh.</p>

<p>A whistle from Gresham warned the girls that
it was time to go back to the school, and in a
short time the Hill-Top boys had to leave, all
but Harvie and Shorty and the tutor, Mr. Anderson.</p>

<p>We piled more brush on the fire that had been
started to warm toes by, and in a little while
we had a blaze that, as dusk came on, lighted up
the whole lake and made up for the lack of a
moon.</p>

<p>I never saw such a wonderful lunch as Mr.
Tucker had brought. There were sandwiches of
all kinds; cream cheese and pimento, chicken,
ham, tongue and lettuce. There was a great
jar of chicken salad, beaten biscuit, cheese
straws, olives, pickles and salted almonds, and
a chocolate cake even larger than Dum's so-called
best hat that Mr. Tucker had sent for the
Thanksgiving spread.</p>

<div class='left'>
"Bleat, my little goat, bleat,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Cover the table with something to eat," sang</span>
Dum. "Zebedee, you seem to me to be working<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
magic. I don't see how all those things could
have been packed in that basket."</div>

<p>"If yours had been the task to 'tote' it this far,
you would have thought there was more than
that in it," he answered.</p>

<p>"Well, ours will be the task to help 'tote' it
back," said Dee in tones muffled by cream cheese.</p>

<p>The crowning wonder of the repast was some
great thermos bottles that finally emerged from
the bottom of the capacious basket. One was
filled with hot coffee and the other with hot
chocolate, and lying snugly by them was a jar
of whipped cream.</p>

<p>"Well, by the great jumping jingo, what
next?" said Shorty. And then funny Mary
Flannigan used her ventriloquist's powers and
made a noise exactly like a puppy trying to get
out of something, and Shorty bit. He dived into
the basket to the assistance of the imaginary
canine!</p>

<p>The coffee and chocolate were smoking hot, in
spite of the long journey they had taken. Mr.
Tucker had made a clever calculation, also, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
to the number of guests, so the drinkables just
did go around.</p>

<p>"I thought I heard Miss Binks say she was
going to have supper with you," said Harvie
Price to Dum.</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed! I fancy she did intend to, but
after she made a hole in the ice with poor little
Page, I reckon she forgot to wait for her invitation."</p>

<p>We ate up every crumb of that supper and
the little birds who hoped to feast on what we
left must have had but poor pickings.</p>

<div class='left'>
"We shan't have to say:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And take the table quite away,'" laughed</span>
Mr. Tucker. "If I had been twins instead of
Tweedles, I'd have brought twice that much."
</div>

<p>We had had enough, and much gayety and
good-humored repartee had made it a very delightful
party. Mr. Anderson proved very agreeable
and made himself pleasant to everybody.
Miss Cox was happy and full of fun, and even
Annie Pore forgot to be shy and actually rolled
Shorty in a patch of snow because he stole a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
piece of chocolate cake, all icing, that she was
saving for the last mouthful.</p>

<p>Everything must have an end, even skating
parties and books&mdash;but there will be more skating
parties and more books, too.</p>

<p>On the way back to Gresham, Mr. Tucker divulged
to us that he had a scheme for pleasure,
and if we girls, one and all, studied hard, and
if Miss Cox would promise to be as blind to our
faults as she honorably could, we were all of us
included in the scheme! He had engaged a cottage
at Willoughby Beach for the month of July
and there we were to camp out and live the simple
life.</p>

<p>"Oh, how grand!" we gasped together.</p>

<p>We had something to look forward to now and
knew that the last half of the year would fly
by. We could hardly wait for the camping time
to come,&mdash;and I just hope my readers are as anxious
to hear about my "Vacation with the Tucker
Twins" as I am anxious to tell them about it!</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
